<h2>Publishers' Note</h2>


<p>Just as this book was about to go to press
an Admiralty Order was issued forbidding the
publication of any text or illustrations likely
to prove of service to the enemy. Proofs of
<cite>The British Navy Book</cite> were submitted to the
Admiralty, with the result that the book has
been approved. Acting in accordance with instructions
from the Lords Commissioners, we
have substituted other illustrations for those
more recent ships previously chosen to represent
the Great War by sea.</p>

<h2>THE BRITISH NAVY BOOK</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Command of the Seas</div>

<div class='center'>(<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1915)</div>

or a Quintessence of an Universal Monarchy."</p>

</div></div>


<p>It is a grey morning out on the North Sea, with but little
wind. There is no swell, but considerable movement on the
surface of the waters, with here and there an occasional
tossing of the white manes of the sea-horses. Swimming
majestically through the sea comes one of our monster
slate-grey battle-cruisers. She is "stripped to a gantline",
and in complete and instant readiness for action. The red
cross of St. George flutters bravely at her fore-topmast head,
for she is the flagship of the squadron of three or four towering
grey ships that are following in her wake. Aft flies the
well-known White Ensign, the "meteor flag of England" blazing
in the corner. Far away on either bow, but dimly discernible on
the wide horizon, are the shadows of other smaller ships, the
light cruisers, which are moving ahead and on the flanks of
the squadron like cavalry covering the advance of an army.
On board is an almost Sabbath-day stillness, save for the wash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the sea, the dull steady whirr of the giant turbines far
down below the armour deck, the periodical clang of the ship's
bell, marking the flight of time. Now and again comes a whiff
of cooking from the galley. As the day advances the light
grows stronger; gleams of sunshine send the purple shadows
of masts and rigging dancing fitfully over the wide deck,
which is practically deserted. There is the marine sentry over
the life-buoy aft, look-outs aloft and at various corners of the
superstructures, and the figures of the officer of the watch,
signalmen and others are seen in movement up in the triangular
platform dignified by the name of the "fore-bridge".
Who would imagine that there are seven or eight hundred
souls on board, seamen, marines, stokers, and many other
ratings of whose existence and duties the "man in the street"
is profoundly ignorant?</p>

</div>

<p>But look inside this massive gun-hood, from which protrude
forty feet of two sleek grey monster cannon, each of
which is capable of hurling 850 pounds of steel and high
explosive a distance of a dozen miles. Grouped round their
guns in various attitudes are the bluejackets forming their
crews. They are tanned and weather-beaten fellows, but
there is a strained and tired look about their eyes. Here in
the confined spaces of their turret they have eaten, slept, and
whiled away the watches as best they might for many, many
hours. They have not had the discomforts of their khaki-clad
brethren in their sodden trenches, nor listened to the
constant hiss of hostile bullets and the howl and crash of
"Jack Johnsons" at unexpected moments. But if they have
been immune from these constant and manifest dangers, they
have had none of their excitements. They have had the
temptation to boredom, and the less exciting but always
present peril of the dastardly German system of mine-laying
in the open sea. Some are writing letters to chums, to sweethearts,
and to wives. Others are killing time with the light
literature that has been sent to the ship in bundles by the
many friends of the fleet on shore. In one corner is a midshipman
writing up his "log", and beside him sits the lieutenant
in charge of the turret reading for the fourth time a
much-folded letter he has taken from an inner pocket.</p>

<p>Look into the next turret and you will see a similar scene,
the only difference being that in this case the guns' crews and
their officer are marines, wearing red-striped trousers and
"Brodrick" caps&mdash;the latter not unlike those of the seamen,
but with the corps badge in brass on a semicircular scarlet
patch in front, instead of a ribband with the ship's name. In
the casemates housing the smaller guns in the superstructures
and on the deck below are similar though smaller groups.
All are waiting&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>We wend our way below. The clerks and writers are
working in their offices, the cooks are busy at their galleys.
Men must eat and accounts must be kept though the ship
should be blown out of existence in the next ten minutes.
We enter a narrow lift and are shot down to the lower regions,
where the sweating stokers handle rake and shovel, the artificers
and engine-room staff ply oil-can and spanner, and the
engineer officers study gauges and dials of all sorts and kinds.
There is more life down here than up above. Work is going
on that needs constant watching and attention. On our
return journey to "the upper air" we glance in at the wireless
room. As we do so comes the loud crackle of the electric
spark. The operator is acknowledging a signal. A message
has come in from a scouting cruiser. "The enemy are out.
Five big cruisers, heading north-west." Another Scarborough
Raid perhaps.</p>

<p>The ship wakes up, she is alive. The engine-room gongs
clang down in her depths. A few signal flags flutter aloft.
The admiral is signalling to his squadron to alter course to
head off the enemy, and to increase speed by so many revolutions.
The big ship gathers way. Her consorts follow in the
curve of her foaming wake, and with every big gun trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a><br /><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
forward the lithe grey leviathans tear over the watery plain
in search of their quarry.</p>

<p>An hour passes. Nothing is seen but the scouting cruisers
and a minute speck in the remote spaces of the sky, which
someone thinks is a sea-plane, but which may well be a grey
gull in the middle distance. Presently, however, a growing
darkness along the north-eastern horizon becomes recognizable
as smoke&mdash;the smoke of many furnaces. Against its growing
blackness one of our distant light cruisers shows for a moment
as a white ship. Black smoke is pouring from her funnels
also, and amidst it all is a sudden violet-white flash.</p>

<p>After an age comes the dull "thud" of her cannon. Now
she turns away to port. There are more vivid flashes and
the "thudding" of her guns grows continuous. Soon answering
flashes sparkle from amidst the smoke-pall on the horizon,
and first one then another nebulous outline of a warship disintegrates
itself. Flashes break from their sides also, and the
noise of the firing swells into a steady roll of sound rising and
falling on the wind. We again increase speed. Black smoke
billows from our funnels, the bow wave rises higher, and now
and again a cloud of spray swishes over our decks. Then
"Cra&mdash;ash!" The fore-turret has spoken. The ship trembles
from stem to stern. We are striking in to the assistance of
our scouting cruiser. Through the glasses appears what looks
like an iceberg towering over the enemy's nearest cruiser.
We've missed her.</p>

<p>But the spotting officer is busy in the control-platform
aloft, passing down corrections for transmission to the various
gun-stations, and when a second explosion roars from the
starboard turret, the enemy's cruiser, after disappearing for
some seconds in a black and inky cloud of smoke, bursts into
flames. Her consort and our scouting vessel draw farther
and farther away to the northward, fighting fiercely. We continue
driving through the tumbling waters, till, with a slight
freshening of the wind, the black smoke we are approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
thins off into nothingness, and we see far down on the horizon
four or five separate columns of smoke. With a good glass
we can distinguish masts and funnels as if lightly sketched
in pencil. They have sighted us at the same time, and
seem to melt together into one indistinct mass. They are
altering course, turning their backs to us and heading for
the east.</p>

<p>The engine-room gongs clang again, more revolutions are
demanded and are forthcoming, and our four big battle-cruisers
rush in pursuit with renewed energy. A distant
humming sound increases quickly to a loud hissing and roaring&mdash;a
noise which may be compared to that of a monster
engine letting off steam&mdash;and an enormous projectile, passing
well over our heads, plunges into the sea on the starboard
beam of our following ship, the splash rising as high as the
mastheads. Others follow fast. The rearmost ship loses her
mainmast, and now the enemy's gunners reduce their elevation
and slap their big shells into the sea just ahead of us.</p>

<p>Our own guns are not idle. One after another gives
tongue with a volume of noise and a concussion that no
words can describe. The pen is powerless to bring before the
imagination such a cataclysm of sound. On a sudden, amidst
the crashing of the guns and the continuous dull booming of
the enemy's in the distance, there is a different and a rending
explosion somewhere forward. We have at last been hit.
Down on the forecastle all is smoke, blackness, torn iron plates
and girders. From the midst of the chaos comes the shriek of
a man calling on his Maker, and piteous groanings. Soon the
dull red of fire blushes through the smoke, and a rush of bluejackets
and marines with fire-hoses spouting white streams
of water engages this dread enemy and succeeds in subduing
it.</p>

<p>Stretcher-men appear on the scene and remove the wounded,
but there is more than one serge-clad figure that lies heedless
of fire or water, friend or foe. These are they who have fought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
their last fight and have laid down their lives and all that
they had for their country.</p>

<p>Inside the turrets the aspect of affairs is very different
from what we saw a short time ago. The gun-layers are
standing at their sights, the guns' crews are working levers
to and fro, the big breech-blocks are swinging on one side, the
huge pointed projectiles rising on their hydraulic hoists till
they come in line with the bore of the gun. Another lever is
pulled, and the rammer-head, hitherto somewhat in the background
of the turret, advances towards the gun, impelled by
what looks not unlike a monster bicycle chain crawling up
from below, and stiffening itself as it advances along a horizontal
trough of steel. The rammer-head meets the base of
the big shell and drives it resistlessly and with no apparent
effort into the gun. It retires; the charges of explosive,
divided into sections and carried in cylinders which come in
turn in line with the breech, are then one after the other
pushed into place by the indefatigable rammer-head, the
breech-block is swung to, turned and locked, and the gun is
ready to fire again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We are now in full view of the enemy's squadron, which
consists of five large armoured cruisers. Two of these are in
a bad way. One on our starboard bow has lost two out of her
three funnels as well as a mast. She is barely moving through
the water, and has a strong list to port, which is so pronounced
as to prevent her elevating her guns, whose projectiles all
strike the water short of us, though we are at comparatively
close range. Only two or three of her larger pieces are able
to fire at all, and these but at intervals. Her foremost turret
is nothing but a chaos of broken metal from the midst of
which a pair of mutilated cannon point forlornly skyward.</p>

<p>The midships turret nearest to us is in hardly better case.
Her superstructures look like the ruins of a town after an
earthquake, and several large holes gape in her sides. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
dense black smoke sweeps upwards from the midst of the
wreckage. About half a mile ahead of her a consort is also
stationary and on fire, the flames driving away in sheets to
leeward. The ship that followed us as second in the line is
very badly damaged also, and is just discernible on the horizon
astern under a pall of smoke. These casualties leave us evenly
matched&mdash;three to three&mdash;with plenty of fight left in us, but
with the volume and efficiency of our fire considerably reduced.
Our own funnels are still standing, but riddled like collanders,
the fore-bridge has been swept away, and with it our dear old
skipper; but his place has been ably filled by the commander,
who is fighting the ship from the conning-tower, which still
stands. Both squadrons&mdash;the German in line ahead, ours
in bow and quarter line&mdash;are heading due east, but, just as
we are abreast the badly damaged cruiser to which I have
referred, the enemy begins edging away to the north-east.
We fail to see the significance of this man&#339;uvre at first, and
the admiral, who, though rather badly hurt by the fall of the
fore-bridge, is still in the conning-tower with the commander,
may have visions of "crossing their T" astern, when there is
a sudden shout from aloft. A man is leaning over and gesticulating
wildly from the control-platform and pointing towards
our starboard bow. There, not far from the burning enemy
ship, the glass shows three pairs of what look like black
cricket-stumps. Simultaneously there is a gleam in the sea
alongside, like the white of a shark's belly when he turns to
seize his prey. The deadly torpedo had missed us by a couple
of feet.</p>

<p>We instantly turn sharply to port, signalling our consorts
to do the same, and all head northwards at our best speed.
This brings the enemy's line, which had been turning more
and more to port, on a parallel course, and all three ships at
once concentrate on us&mdash;the nearest ship. We get a worse
hammering in the five minutes that follow than we have sustained
during the action. The after turret is jammed, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the guns in the starboard turret loses its muzzle, and fire
breaks out in two places amidships, and can only be got under
with the most strenuous efforts and great loss of life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

target, such as a towed kite, is easier to hit than an aeroplane.</span>
</div>

<p>Things are looking ugly. The submarines still follow
astern, but are not near enough to risk a shot. We cannot
steam any faster, and we are baulking the fire of our
friends. We slow down, risking the submarines, to allow our
consorts to get ahead of us and enable us to meet the three
enemy ships on equal terms. There are many anxious looks
astern while this man&#339;uvre is in execution. The periscopes
of our submarine foes are still discernible, but beyond them
is a fast-growing smoke-cloud from which presently emerge
the lithe black hulls of our "X" destroyer flotilla. Apparently
the submarines do not observe their approach; their periscopes
are steadily fixed on our ship, reckoning every yard they gain
on us. But the destroyers see <em>them</em>, and presently we see also
a warning signal from the enemy flagship. But it is too late.
Before the <i>Unterseeische Böte</i> can dive out of harm's way
three or four destroyers sweep over them and ram them at
the speed of an express train. Slowing down, they circle right
and left and open fire. What at we cannot see. Presently
up pops a grey lump some way astern. The light guns on
the superstructure give tongue so quickly that one has hardly
time to recognize it as the conning-tower of a submarine
before it is literally blown to pieces.</p>

<p>For the first time during the fight a cheer rings out fore
and aft. Almost at once the little guns begin banging away
again. This time their long muzzles are nosing about in the
air. What are they firing at? "There they are!" cries someone,
pointing to the south-east, where two big amorphous monsters
have appeared high up in the clouds. Zeppelins, right enough;
and the bang, bang, bang of the lighter artillery rises in crescendo
from every ship and destroyer till the air echoes like
Vulcan's forge. Up come the pair of enormous sausages at
a high rate of speed, and as they pass over our destroyer
flotilla they begin dropping their bombs. Dull concussions
thud apparently on the ship's bottom; fountains of white
water spout all round the small craft.</p>

<p>But none are hit. The leading "gas-bag" is heading
straight for us. She has probably spotted our damaged condition,
and reckons us an easy prey. But our gunners are
getting closer to her every shot, and presently she turns slowly
to starboard, dropping a futile bomb as she goes. She now
presents a fine broadside target as big as a Dreadnought,
another shot gets home somewhere, and she makes off in the
direction she came with her nose down, tail in air, and a pronounced
list to port. Her consort turns too, and scuttles off
at top speed. She hopes to "live to fight another day" over
some peaceful English village where there are no nasty, disagreeable
quick-firing guns, shrapnel-shell, and other unkind
greetings from those she would destroy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day is drawing to a close. We are heading homewards
in tow of a consort. Low down under the tawny sunset that
dim purple line is the coast of "Old England"&mdash;the motherland
we are engaged in defending from the assault of the
most unscrupulous enemy she has ever encountered. The
wind has fallen, the waves are hardly more than ripples, and
evening is closing down with a soothing hush over land and
sea. We have cleared up after the smashing and racket of
the battle as far as possible, but we can hardly crawl along,
and are bound to go into dockyard hands for some weeks at
any rate.</p>

<p>"Are we downhearted?" "No!" For we have given much
better than the best efforts of the Huns could give. Two of
their ships are at the bottom, with most of their crews; though,
thanks to the exertions and humanity of our gallant seamen,
a considerable number of them have been saved from a watery
grave. To this bag may be added three if not four submarines
and a badly damaged Zeppelin, so we are not ill-satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the day's work. We have just passed several "tall ships" on
their way out to relieve us on patrol, and as we begin to get
under the land there is a whirring up aloft in the gathering
dusk, and a dozen sea-planes, like a flight of wild-ducks, come
swooping seaward and make towards the Channel.</p>

<p>Where are they off to? Are they patrolling, or are they
bent on a raid on the enemy's magazines, hangars, and gun
positions? We do not know, but our ignorance does not worry
us. We know the kind of man that is flying down there towards
the southern horizon, and are quite satisfied that he
will "make a good job" of whatever he has in hand. Just
as the sun dips, out comes a destroyer from the shadow of the
land to pilot us through the mine-field, and so we are brought
"into the harbour where we would be". We have plenty of
hard work before us&mdash;some of it very sad work. There are
our poor wounded shipmates down below in the sick-bay who
have to be taken ashore to hospital, and there are the last
honours to be paid to those other gallant comrades and shipmates
who have "fought the good fight" and are now making
their last voyage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for that promised land where "there
shall be no more sea".</p>

<p>And now let us consider how this guardian fleet and the
men who man it came into being. In the following pages my
object will be not so much to describe well-known sea-fights
as to give a series of pictures of the sailor and of the navy at
different stages of "our island story".</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> we want to find out anything about the early
history of Great Britain, we have, almost invariably, to turn
to the writings of our old friend Julius Cæsar. In attempting
to trace the beginnings of the Royal Navy, that magnificent
organization "whereon", point out the <cite>Articles of
War</cite>, "under the good Providence of God, the Wealth, Safety,
and Strength of the Kingdom chiefly depend", we have to
conform to the same rule, and consult this authority. From
Cæsar's <cite>De Bello Gallico</cite> we learn that in his time the Ancient
Britons made use of boats with a wooden frame, supporting
wicker-work instead of planking, and rendered watertight by
a covering of skins&mdash;just such boats, in fact, though probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
larger&mdash;as, under the name of "coracles", are used to
this day on the Wye and some other rivers and estuaries.</div>

<p>The portability and rapid construction of these boats commended
them to Cæsar's military eye, and later on, in one
of his Continental wars, he ordered his soldiers to make some
light boats in imitation of those he had seen in Britain, in
order to carry his army across a river. But, though Cæsar
especially mentions these vessels, he does not say that the
British of his day had no other or larger vessels. Though
they made use of hides and wicker, they must have known
something of wooden vessels. There is no doubt that they
or their ancestors had large "dug-outs", hollowed from huge
trunks of trees in the same way as Robinson Crusoe constructed
his famous boat. We know this because many of
these have been discovered buried in the mud of our rivers.
One of them, found in the bed of the Rother in 1822, was
60 feet in length and 5 feet wide. Others have been found
in Lincolnshire, Scotland, and Sussex, though none of them
was nearly as long as the Rother boat. We must remember,
too, that the Ph&#339;nicians had traded to Cornwall for tin,
probably for centuries, and the Britons must have been
familiar with their comparatively advanced types of shipbuilding.</p>

<p>But many writers on naval matters are of the opinion
that our British ancestors, whose coracles are described by
Cæsar, had, even at that time, really stout and formidable
ships. The reason is this. The Veneti, a race who inhabited
western Brittany, and the country at the mouth of the Loire,
were a kindred race, and when attacked by Cæsar received
assistance from Britain. Now the strength of the Veneti
seems to have been in their ships, which gave the Roman
galleys considerable trouble, and it seems more than likely
that the British assistance they received came in the form of
a squadron of similar vessels.</p>

<p>According to Cæsar, the ships of the Veneti "were built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and fitted out in this manner: their bottoms were somewhat
flatter than ours, the better to adapt them to the shallows,
and to sustain without danger the ebbing of the tide. Their
prows were very high and erect, as likewise their sterns, to
bear the hugeness of the waves and the violence of the tempests.
The hull of the vessel was entirely of oak, to withstand
the shocks and assaults of that stormy ocean. The
benches of the rowers were made of strong beams about a foot
wide, and were fastened with iron bolts an inch in thickness.
Instead of cables they used chains of iron, and for their sails,
utilized skins and a sort of thin, pliable leather, either because
they had no canvas and did not know how to make sailcloth
or, more probably, because they thought that canvas sails
were not so suitable to stand the violence of the tempests,
the fury and rage of the winds, and to propel ships of such
bulk and burden". It is evident that these ships were for
that period quite up to date. They were strongly built and
iron-bolted, and had already discarded hempen cables for iron
ones.</p>

<p>Above all, they were specially constructed to battle with
the heavy weather of the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea,
and to take refuge from its fury in the rivers and creeks of
the western coasts of Europe. The Roman galleys, relying
principally on their oars, and therefore comparatively long
and light, were not so seaworthy in Northern waters, and the
same difference, in construction, between the ships of the
Mediterranean and those of the Northern nations may be
traced right down to comparatively modern ages. One gets
very bad weather in the Mediterranean at times, notwithstanding
its traditional blue skies and sapphire seas, but the
big Atlantic rollers are absent.</p>

<p>These ships of the Veneti proved a tough morsel for our
old school acquaintance, but his generalship was equal to the
task of overcoming them in the end. As he says, "in agility
and a ready command of oars, we had the advantage", for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the Veneti trusted entirely to their sails. But, against that,
the beaks of the Roman galleys could make no impression on
the stout timber of the enemy's ships, they were at a special
disadvantage in bad weather, and the bulwarks of the Venetan
ships towered so high above their heads, even when they
erected their fighting-towers, that the Roman soldiers could
not hurl their darts on board them, while the Venetan enemy
showered their missiles down upon their heads. For the
same reason they found it almost impossible to grapple with
and make fast to the big ships, and so carry them by boarding.
However, "there are more ways than one of killing a cat",
and so the Venetans found to their cost. For the Romans,
fastening sharp hooks or sickles to the end of long poles,
pulled alongside, hooked them over the halyards of their yards
and sails, and, rowing away for all they were worth, contrived
to cut them through, when down came the yards, and the
Venetan vessels became unmanageable. To make matters
worse, when a flat calm fell they could not get away to their
hiding-places on the coast, and the Romans obtained a complete
victory&mdash;probably by boarding and fighting at close
quarters, when their armour and discipline would tell heavily
in their favour. It is interesting to note, by the way, that,
according to Vegetius, a fifteenth-century writer on naval
and military matters, they painted their scouting-vessels blue,
masts, sails, and all, and dressed their crews in the same
colour. He adds that Pompey, after defeating Cæsar, called
himself "The Son of Neptune", and "affected to wear the <em>blue</em>
or <em>marine</em> colour". As for the Veneti, we may, perhaps, regard
them as the original "Bluejackets", Veneti being the plural
of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venetus</i>, "bluish", "sea-coloured".</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 181px;">

<span class="caption">Ancient Roman Tile found at Dover<br />The letters stamped into this tile, and others
like it found elsewhere, are considered to stand
for &quot;Classiarii Britannici&quot;, i.e. &quot;British troops
trained for sea-warfare&quot;.</span>
</div>

<p>We have now to pass over a gap of several hundred years,
during which time there is little or no information available
about the ships belonging to these islands, the greater part
of which, as a matter of fact, had become a province of the
Roman Empire. There seems to have been a "Classis Britannici",<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
or British squadron, but this was entirely a Roman
organization, and had as much to do with the north of France&mdash;or
Gaul&mdash;as Britain. The remains of an old ship&mdash;just the
keel and lower ribs&mdash;which were not long ago unearthed on
the right bank of the Thames, just below Westminster Bridge,
are considered likely to have belonged to a galley of this
squadron, and we know that there was a legion of what we
may term British Marines, who formed the fighting portion
of the fleet. Tiles have
been found at Dover and
other known stations
of the Romano-British
Fleet which bear the
following inscription:
"C.L., B.R.", which the
experts in such matters
interpret as standing for
"Classiarii Britannici"&mdash;that
is to say, "British
troops trained for sea-warfare".
We are also
told by Vegetius, the old
writer I have already
quoted, that the badge
of these troops was a
"circle", which, by the
way, is a somewhat curious coincidence, since that of the
Marines of our own day is a globe. These were the men who
defended the shores of our island against the growing numbers
of pirates from northern Europe, for the rowers of the Roman
galleys were merely the machinery of propulsion, and were
probably much less considered than the steam-engines of
a modern battleship. These troops also manned part of the
wall built from the North Sea to the Solway in the vain
attempt to keep out the Picts and Scots, for traces of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are to be found at Bowness at its western end. The North
Sea pirates, then generally referred to as Saxons, became such
a menace that the East Coast received the name of "The
Saxon Shore", and a "count" or high official was specially
appointed to take charge of its defence.</p>

the rim is white, and the remainder green.</span>
</div>

<p>In <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 410 the Romans, attacked by the northern nations
in their own country, finally abandoned Britain. The British,
who had been practically
a subject race for nearly
400 years, could make
no head against the fierce
Picts and Scots, who at
once took advantage of
the withdrawal of the
Roman garrison and
swarmed into the North
of England. In desperation,
the British king,
Vortigern, offered to buy
the assistance of two
Jutish or Saxon pirates&mdash;Hengist
and Horsa&mdash;who
were doing a little
raiding on their own
account on the southern
coast. They drove off the northern invaders, in accordance
with the bargain that was struck, but, returning home for
more of their Danish and Saxon fellow-countrymen, came
back and gradually got the country into their own hands.
According to another theory, many colonies of Saxons had
been established on the East Coast during the time of the
Romans, and it was the special business of the "Count of the
Saxon Shore" to rule over them. However this may have
been, England became a Saxon country, the remnant of the
Britons being driven into Wales and Cornwall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the Scandinavian peoples were at this time the finest
sailors in the world. The Jutes and Angles from Denmark
and Schleswig-Holstein belonged to this race, the whole of
which became known as "vikings"&mdash;that is to say, "the sons
of the creeks", from the Scandinavian word <i>vik</i>, a bay,
creek, or fiord. But though there must have been a strong
Viking element among the Saxon conquerors of England&mdash;so
much so that it became known as Angle-land, or England,
from the Angles&mdash;yet the Saxons or English do not seem to
have taken so enthusiastically to the sea as the Norwegians
and Danes, and, except when special efforts to create fighting
fleets were made by King Alfred and Edmund Ironside, were
never able to prevent the incursions of their Danish and
Norse kinsmen, who, in process of time, firmly established
themselves in the country. After the Danes came the Norman
Conquest, and during all this period there was little,
if any, change in the types of the ships in which the northern
nations fared the seas.</p>

</div>
<p>What were these vessels like? As it happens, we really
know more about them than we do of any between their time
and the days of Henry VIII. For not only have we very
definite details of them and their "gear" in the long "sagas"
or historical and traditional poems which have come down to
us, sculptured pictures of them in stone, engravings on rocks
and upon arms and ornaments, but more than one of the
actual Viking vessels have been dug out of the big burial-mounds
where they had been hidden for centuries. For the
Viking chieftain loved his ship: he lavished ornament and
decoration upon it, and regarded it almost as a living thing.
When, therefore, the time came for him to take the long last
voyage, from which no man ever returns, it was quite natural
that he should have wished to make it in the cherished
"Dragon Ship" or "Long Serpent", which had so often borne
him over the waves on his way to those hand-to-hand combats
and harryings and plunderings in which his soul delighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Sometimes a funeral pyre was erected on the ship herself, and
with his favourite sword by his side, his shield and his helmet,
the dead chieftain set out on his final voyage, his sons and
followers watching the well-known long-ship sailing into the
west till she, her sails, and her dead captain disappeared in
clouds of fire and smoke under the sunset. Or, again, a dying
sea-king would elect to be buried in his favourite ship in
some spot overlooking the glassy fiord whence he had so
often set out on his piratical exploits. The ship was run up
on shore over the rollers which all Viking vessels carried to
facilitate beaching, the body was laid amidships with his most
treasured earthly possessions, a penthouse of timber was built
over him, his favourite horses were killed and placed round
the hull of the vessel, and the whole was buried in the depths
of a huge mound, which was erected over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The most famous "finds" of this kind
were at Gokstadt, in south Norway, in 1881,
and at Nydam, in Schleswig, in 1863. In
the latter case the ship does not seem to have
been used as a sarcophagus, but with another,
which had almost entirely rotted away, was
found in a bog. Possibly if the huge oval
mound now utilized as a cemetery at Inverness,
and known as "Tom-na-hurich" ("The
Hill of the Fairies"), were tunnelled into, another
Viking ship might be brought to light.
In the case of the Nydam ship, Roman
coins found on board fix her date as being
somewhere about <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 250. Both from these
ships and fragments of others that have
been found in various places it is abundantly
evident that their builders were as
skilled shipwrights as ever existed. Space
does not allow us to go into details of their
construction, but we may say at once that
their finish was perfect, and that their
lines were not only beautiful but wonderfully
well adapted for contending with the
stormy waters of the northern seas. Neither
of them appears to have belonged to the
largest type of Viking ships, which may be
roughly divided into "Dragon Ships" or
"Drakkars", "Eseneccas" or "Long Serpents",
and "Skutas" or small swift scouting-vessels.
It seems just possible, by the
way, that our modern slang expression
"skoot"&mdash;"get away quickly", "clear out"&mdash;may
be derived from this word. We
must try in the next chapter to understand
what these Viking ships were like.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>Ancient War-ships</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"Piracy was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue of the Scandinavian
youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow limits, they started from the banquet,
grasped their arms, sounded their horn, ascended their ships, and explored
every coast that promised either spoil or settlement."     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <span class="smcap">Gibbon.</span></p></div>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">If</span> we take the dimensions of the actual Viking boats that
have been unearthed, as I have related in the last chapter,
we shall have an excellent foundation upon which to form
an idea of the bigger and more important ones. Now the
Gokstadt boat is nearly 80 feet long and 16 feet 6 inches
wide at her greatest beam, and carried mast and sail. The
Nydam ship is 75 feet in length, with a beam of 10 feet
6 inches, and had no mast. Both are very flat amidships,
and have very fine or sharp ends, but it is evident that in
proportion to her length the Gokstadt boat had a much greater
beam.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i038.jpg" width="600" height="309" alt="drawing of a long ship" />
<div class="caption">A Viking Double-prowed &quot;Long Serpent&quot; or &quot;Dragon-ship&quot;<br /><p>Observe the well-supported outer stem, the Dragon Head, the embroidered sail decorated with a variation of the &quot;Swastika&quot;
design, which was much used by the Vikings on arms and ornaments; the vane at the masthead, the &quot;shield-row&quot; protecting the
rowers, and the steersman guiding the ship by means of her &quot;steer-board&quot;.</p></div>
</div>

<p>That was because she was a sailing-ship and the Nydam
vessel was not. The latter may fairly be assumed to have been
a "Skuta", and the Gokstadt ship a rather small "Serpent".
Now in all the "sagas" that have come down to us the
different war-ships which occupy so prominent a place in them
are distinguished as to size by the number of oars they pulled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a><br /><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
From the Nydam ship, which had fourteen oars a-side, we are
thus able to judge the dimensions of famous Viking war-ships
like the "Long Serpent" of King Olaf and others, if we allow
for the slightly wider space between the rowers' benches
necessitated by the greater length of the oars in the larger
vessels. Of course, the whole length of the ship was not
occupied by the benches. In the Nydam ship, for instance,
they took up 46 feet of her length; the remaining 15 feet
at each end were required for fighting- and steering-platforms,
stowage of stores, &amp;c. In this way it has been calculated that
the "Long Serpent"&mdash;you must remember that this was a
<em>special</em> "Long Serpent", and probably bigger than the usual
run of the war-vessels so-called&mdash;was 180 feet long, while the
still bigger ship belonging to our King Canute works out at
no less than 300 feet in length. The beam or width it has
not been found possible to estimate exactly, but my own
opinion is that the lines, or contour, of these very much
bigger ships were much deeper and fuller than in the smaller
types.</p>

<p>There is an old manuscript in the Bodleian Library, at
Oxford, dating from about <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 1000, in which appear three
pictures of Noah's Ark (see p. 26). The house part of the
design is frankly impossible&mdash;it would capsize the ship&mdash;but
the hull in each case&mdash;the boat part&mdash;is not at all unlike the
well-known Bayeux-tapestry ships, but of a better and more
seaworthy shape, though in some of them the big dragon
figure-head is unduly exaggerated. The space between the
benches was called a "room", and the port and starboard portions
of this were known as "half-rooms". The crew were
all told off to these half-rooms as their stations, except those
quartered forward and aft. Thus the "Long Serpent" had
eight men to each "half-room", and from this item of information
it has been estimated that she carried a crew of something
between six and seven hundred men. Goodness knows
how many King Canute's big "Dreadnought" carried.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of these Viking ships were very smartly decorated.
Armorial bearings had not then been invented, but
their sails were worked with the most beautiful emblematic
and intricate embroidery, and were not infrequently made
of velvet, though generally of a coarse woollen material
called "vadmal." Some of
the most elaborate ones were
actually lined with fur. Not
only the ships themselves,
but also their sails, like the
swords of their warriors,
were given poetical sounding
names: "The Cloth of the
Wind", "The Beard of the
Yard", and "The Tapestry of
the Mast-head", are some of
them. Along their gunwales,
above the oars, which worked
through holes in the ship's
side, ran the "shield-row",
composed of circular wooden
shields or targets, with big
shining bosses of brass or other
metal in the middle. Each
shield overlapped the next till
it touched its boss, and so gave
a double protection to the
rowers. This was a very ancient custom, as shields were
carried in this way by Ph&#339;nician ships as far back as 450 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>
As a general rule, the Norsemen's shields were black and
yellow, the Danes' red, and the Saxons' white with red or
blue edges.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i040.jpg" width="165" height="250" alt="drawing of a dragon figure-head" />
<span class="caption">A &quot;Dragon&quot; Figure-head<br />There was a law that ships must not approach
the land with their figure-heads in position
with &quot;gaping heads and yawning snouts.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It is rather curious that, with the exception of black, these
colours are conspicuous in the flags of the corresponding
nations of to-day. But the King of Norway presented our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
King Athelstan, in 931, with a ship fitted with a complete row
of <em>golden</em> shields.</p>

<p>A whole chapter might be written about the figure-heads
of the Viking ships, for they were much more than mere ornaments.
They each had some special signification, and were
certainly connected with a most extraordinary superstition
which prevailed among the Scandinavian peoples. It is best
explained by an example from the saga of which one Egil
was the hero. Pursued by a king answering to the suggestive
name of Blood-axe, he escaped from Norway and took ship
to Iceland. Before he set sail over the North Sea he determined
to take it out of his enemy, Blood-axe, by a species
of what we may call "wireless" witchcraft. Landing on an
islet, he erected what was known as a "Nithstang", a "contraption"
considered very pleasing to the Norse gods. The
idea probably had something in common with the "lifting
up" of the brazen serpent in the <cite>Book of Numbers</cite>. His installation
was a very simple one: a hazel pole with a horse's
head stuck on the top. He stuck it up in a crevice of the
rocks, saying that he did so "as a curse" on Blood-axe and
his Queen. Then he turned it round so as to point to the
mainland, and announced that he also "fired off" his curse
at the "Guardian Spirits" of the country, who were to get
no rest till they had hustled King Blood-axe out of it. Finally
he inscribed his curse in Runic characters on the pole, and
continued his voyage to Iceland as pleased with himself as
a German hero who had dropped a floating mine in the track
of passenger vessels.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">

<span class="caption">A Dragon-head and a Representation of a &quot;Nithstang&quot;. From a Saxon MS.</span>
</div>

<p>Now it appears that these same guardian spirits were
extremely susceptible to this sort of "wireless", not only in
Norway, but everywhere. And it also seems that&mdash;how or
in what way I am unable to explain&mdash;the figure-heads of the
Viking ships had much the same properties as the "Nithstangs".
So it was that in Iceland, at any rate, there was
a law that ships must remove their figure-heads before approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the land, "and not approach it with gaping heads
and yawning snouts", lest they might scare the guardian
spirits of the land.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Having carried out this regulation, it
was customary for the seamen to hoist a polished shield to
the masthead and so flash the signal that the guardian spirits
need not now be alarmed. That some connection existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
between these "heads" and the "Nithstang" is further shown
by a drawing in an old manuscript of that period, which
depicts a human head set on a pole, which is fastened to
a dragon figure-head. And again, in a wall-painting in the
church of Tegelsmora in Upland, in which the famous King
Olaf is seen waging a desperate battle with our old nursery
friends the "Trolls", the bowsprit of his ship is adorned with
the skull of an ox.</p>

<p>But we must leave the ships and come to their crews.
To begin with, they were all "soldiers and sailors too"! They
were equally at home on the battle-field ashore and in handling
their cherished "long-ships" afloat. The Scandinavians
believed that the soul of a warrior killed in battle went at
once to Valhalla, which represented their idea of heaven.</p>

<p>There they confidently expected that the brave fighter
would spend a happy eternity of fighting and feasting. It
is said that their remote forefathers had brought this weird
form of belief from the depths of Central Asia&mdash;but that must
be a very old story. But fighting was the breath of their life.
They revelled in it, though they did not despise the plunder
which was generally the reward of victory. Many of these
fierce warriors were subject to and even cultivated a species
of madness, almost amounting to demoniacal possession, which
induced them to tear off their clothes and hurl themselves
almost naked into the fray, feeling endued with the strength
of seven men.</p>

<p>These "Berserkers", as they were called from this custom,
were doubtless most dangerous opponents in their "Berserk"
fury. Nowadays it is generally accepted that the braver the
man the more modest he is about his deeds of valour; the
boaster is considered likely to be but a broken reed in the
day of battle. But it was quite otherwise with the Viking
warriors. They gloried in boasting aloud of their prowess,
of the deeds they had done, and of those that they were ready
to perform.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The tactics of the Vikings, if they failed to ram their
opponents, was to lash the bows of as many friendly and
hostile vessels together as possible, so as to form a floating
battle-field. The fighting-platforms were not, apparently,
raised above the bows, as later on in mediæval times. They
were somewhere about the level of the
gunwale, and when several ships were
lashed together, all these platforms
provided a battle-ground upon which
the Berserker and his emulators could
indulge in the furious hand-to-hand
combats which were their delight. If
they could do this they were probably
more than pleased that they had
failed to ram their enemy. I doubt
if every ship was built with a ram,
but, on the other hand, it is certain
that some ships were specially built
for use as rams, and even strengthened
by iron plating. So that we see that
the armour-clad is no new invention.</p>

always bit their &quot;shield-rims&quot;
on going into battle.</span>
</div>

<p>In the larger "long-ships" a fighting-gangway
ran along behind the
shield-row, connecting the fore and
after platforms. Beneath the latter,
which was somewhat elevated so that
the steersman could look ahead, was the sleeping-place for
the commander of the ship. Other sleeping accommodation
was provided under the foremost platform, while, if at
anchor, those of the crew who were not on watch slept under
awnings or tents, set up on framework which could be
erected for the purpose in the centre of the vessel. The men
slept in leather bags, which were equally useful either ashore
or afloat. In short, these ancient war-vessels were so well
and scientifically built, so well arranged and equipped, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
so well manned that we cease to wonder at the long voyages
they were able to perform by taking advantage of the summer
months.</p>

<p>The Dragon or other figure-head has been unshipped, possibly because the galley
is going into port.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that the Vikings discovered
the continent of America long before Columbus did.
They went by way of Iceland, and so were able to touch land
more than once on their journey, but they got there all the
same. They established a colony in Greenland about <span class='small'>A.D.</span> 985.
From there they made several expeditions to the southward,
and discovered a densely wooded country which is supposed
to have been some portion of Nova Scotia. The climate of
Greenland must have been very different from what it is at
present, for the Viking colony lasted for 400 years, till, in
the fifteenth century, an enormous mass of ice was swept
down by the Arctic current, piled itself up along the coast,
and entirely cut off the settlement&mdash;which at that time consisted
of thirty villages with their churches and monasteries&mdash;from
the rest of the world, so that before long every trace
of it disappeared.</p>

<p>It seems possible that some of you may say: "This is all
very interesting, but I thought we were going to read about
the British Navy, and it seems to me that the Saxons and
their ships represented the British navy of those days". That
is a fair argument, but for my part I do <em>not</em> think that we
can accept the Saxon Navy as the ancestor of the British
Navy of to-day.</p>

<p>The Saxons were no seamen, and apparently but poor
soldiers. When King Alfred built a navy of ships, which
are stated to have been superior in every way to those of
the Frisians, Scandinavians, and Danes, and by means of
which he succeeded in securing more than one victory, he
could not provide them with seamen. The Saxons were no
good, and he had to hire Frisian pirates to man them. The
Saxons fought well at Hastings, but, though there was a
strong infusion of the Danish element by this time, they lost
the battle through lack of discipline and military experience.
It is difficult, therefore, to recognize in these Saxons
the progenitors of men like Lieutenant Holbrook, who navigated
his submarine through and under rows and rows of
deadly mines, knowing that the least touch would bring
annihilation, or of Private Pym of the Berkshires, who, <em>alone</em>
and "on his own", rushed into a house held by a detachment
of German soldiers and succeeded in killing the whole of them
but three, who "made their escape".</p>

<p>No. For the ancestors of the British seamen and sailors
of Elizabethan and modern times I think we should rather
look to the Danes, who, it must be remembered, between
870 and the Norman Conquest, were not only continually
invading England, but established themselves in a great part
of it, especially in the east and north, and to those of the
Conqueror's followers who traced their descent directly from
the Northmen or Vikings. It is their spirit which has brought
us victory both by land and by sea, but more especially by sea,
and not the spirit of Alfred's Saxon subjects, who had to pay
others to fight for them. Again, take such pre-eminent commanders
as Drake and Nelson. Is not the former name one
which takes us directly back to the "Draakers", the "Dragon-ships"
of the Vikings, and has not Nelson a distinctly Danish
sound about it?</p>

<p>The ships of King Alfred "were full-nigh twice as long
as the others; some had sixty oars, and some had more; they
were both swifter and steadier, and also higher, than the
others. They were shapen neither like the Frisian nor the
Danish; but so it seemed to him that they would be most
efficient."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a><br /><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">William the Conqueror</span>, like Cortez, the discoverer of
Mexico at a later date, dispelled any thoughts of retreat that
might have been lurking in the minds of his followers by
destroying the ships which had brought them over. He had
come to stay. Now the Normans, though of the same blood
as the seafaring Vikings, who had sailed and fought their
Dragon-ships to the very ends of the known earth, had been
so long settled in France that they had adopted not only the
French language, but French ideas, which were not, generally
speaking, of a nautical nature.</div>

<p>Among these was the system of feudalism and knight-service.
The very word for knight&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier</i> in French&mdash;signified
a horseman; and the Norman and other feudal
knights of the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth
centuries looked at war and politics from the point of view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a cavalier armed cap-à-pie seated in his war-saddle. As for
ships and sailors, they were merely unpleasant means to
necessary ends.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But if one wanted to go to fight and
plunder and raid across Channel he had to submit himself
and his followers to the cramped accommodation of a vessel
of some kind, and to the care of the rough shipmaster and his
crew&mdash;low but necessary persons, in the eyes of the mediæval
knight, just as were the experienced "tarpawlins" in the
estimate of the scented "gentleman-captains" in the days of
the Restoration. So it came about that for some centuries
England had no Royal Navy.</p>

<p>The king and his principal nobles had at times a few
galleys or sailing-vessels of their own&mdash;almost, if not entirely,
their personal property&mdash;and these they made use of for purposes
of transportation or fighting when required; but during
this period the maritime defence of the realm was carried out&mdash;on
the whole inefficiently&mdash;on the hire system. The money
for this purpose was forthcoming, since William revived a
tax for defence purposes, called the "Heregeld", which had
been not long before abolished by Edward the Confessor, on
the pretext that by it "the people were manifoldly distressed".
Had he not listened to the "little navyites" of his day,
perhaps the Norman Invasion would not have succeeded. In
addition to this, William placed the five principal ports commanding
the narrowest part of the Channel on a special footing,
under which, in return for certain privileges, they were
to supply him or his successors with a fleet of fifty-two ships
in cases of emergency. They could only be retained for fifteen
days, however. These ports&mdash;Hastings, Romney, Hythe,
Dover, and Sandwich&mdash;were then, and for ever afterwards
known as the "Cinque Ports", though Dover is the only one
which can still be regarded as a port at all. Rye, Winchelsea,
and Pevensey also became "Cinque Ports" later on.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>William's idea with regard to the Cinque Ports was probably
not so much the general defence of the kingdom as the
defence of his communications with Normandy. With their
assistance he could be sure of always being able to move
troops either way across Channel as his exigencies required.
Thus, when in 1083 William, who was then in Normandy,
heard rumours of the intention of the Kings of Denmark and
Norway and the Count of Flanders to invade England with a
great fleet, he hurried over-Channel with so great an army
that "men wondered how this land could feed all that force".
Without the assistance of the Cinque Ports he might have
had some difficulty in doing this.</p>

<p>Although we really know a great deal about the ships of
the Saxon and Danish periods of our history, we know comparatively
little about those which were built between the
Conquest and the accession of Henry VII. For, while we have
had specimens of the actual Viking ships to work upon, we
have for this long period, of over 400 years, little information
beyond that afforded by the seals of maritime towns, the
ships depicted by monkish chroniclers and romancists in their
illuminated manuscripts, and in a few cases old stained-glass
windows and decorative carvings.</p>

<p>Now, to begin with, it is obvious that in each of these
cases the artist was cramped for space. He had to decide
between the calls of accuracy and of decorative effect, and
almost invariably he gave way to the latter.</p>

<p>In seals, especially, he was tempted to make the curves of
the ship's hull run parallel to the circumference of the seal.
In that which belonged to the master of the <i>Sainte Catherine
de Cayeux</i>, which fought at Sluys in 1340, the exterior curve
of the hull of the ship represented upon it is really concentric
with the seal itself. In almost every other case&mdash;up to the
fifteenth century at any rate&mdash;the hulls of the ships shown
on seals of this description approximate to this shape, and,
generally speaking, are of crescent form, with fighting-stages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
or "castles" at the bow and stern. There are a few exceptions,
which are more likely to be correct, as their designers evidently
made up their minds not to be led away from the truth.</p>

<p>In the rather fascinating pictures that appear in mediæval
manuscripts, too, the monkish artists had to work in a small
space, in which they
wanted to put a great
deal of ornamental and
other detail. They probably
knew little or nothing
about nautical affairs
into the bargain. In the
result their ships present
the same crescent-shaped
hulls as those in the seals
of the period, and give
the impression of being
very small affairs indeed,
thanks to the large-sized
nobles and men-at-arms
with which they are
densely packed.</p>

<p>An example of the impossible ship. Note how the
engraver has made the keel exactly parallel to the
circumference of the seal. It makes a handsome and
effective seal, but can hardly be accepted as a picture
of a ship of 1340.</p></div>

<p>The reason of this
quaint method of representing
ships and their
crews or passengers is
not far to seek. Who has not seen a child's first attempts to
draw the human face in profile? He outlines the forehead,
the nose, and chin, and puts in the back of the head easily and
to his own satisfaction. Then he pauses and deliberates. The
eyes are what he is puzzling over. He knows that, though
everybody has one nose, one forehead, and one chin, he has <em>two</em>
eyes. What about them? He may think that one eye looks
most suitable, but still he doesn't like to leave the other one
out. So, as often as not, he puts in a couple, one about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
right place and the other somewhere towards the back of the
head.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 281px;">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" width="281" height="236" alt="ship wth four people filling it" />
<div class="caption">Wreck of the White Ship, 1120<br />

<p>Another example of the impossible-ship picture. There were said to be 300 souls on
board! Observe the rudder, which proves the date of the original drawing to be much
later than 1120&mdash;probably 100 or 150 years.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The tonsured artist argued very much on the same lines.
If he painted a ship it was not a picture of a special ship.
What he wanted to portray was the saint or hero of his
manuscript&mdash;very often Alexander the Great&mdash;on a voyage
or crossing a river. If he drew him on the same scale as his
vessel he would be a mere dot or blob of paint. He wanted
to show his face, his armour, robes, crown, halo, or what-not.
So, though he could not help knowing that it was inaccurate,
he drew him&mdash;and, generally speaking, his companions&mdash;on a
scale about 500 per cent larger than that of the ship in which
he was depicted as performing a most cramped and uncomfortable
voyage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>We must not therefore accept these brilliantly coloured
works of art as corroborative of the accuracy of the figures
of ships appearing on the seals of Dover, Yarmouth, Poole,
and other English and foreign ports, and in the fifteenth
century of various noblemen who held the appointment of
Admiral of England or France. But there are, nevertheless,
a great many useful details to be learned from these sources
of information. From seals we can trace the gradual evolution
of the poop and forecastle from the early platforms or
fighting-stages, the supersession of the steering-oar or "steer-board"
by the rudder, the beginning of cabins, the progress
of fighting-tops and action aloft. We see, too, the mode of
wearing banners, streamers, and flags, and gain some idea of
the gradual growth of sail-power, which culminated, we may
say, in the sailing battleship of Trafalgar days.</p>

<p>If we consider the question of mediæval shipbuilding as
a whole, we shall find it difficult to believe that the scientific
methods of construction which distinguished the Viking ships,
and the improvements on them which were made by Alfred
the Great, had all been forgotten and thrown on one side, and
that these fine specimens of the shipbuilder's art had been
replaced by anything like the ridiculous little "cocked hats"
that are supposed to represent the shipping of the British
and other Northern nations between 1066 and 1450.</p>

<p>The sea-going ships of these peoples, intended especially
for sailing, would naturally be considerably shorter and
broader in the beam than the Viking class of ship, which
relied principally on oars for propulsion, and was rather too
long and narrow to sail well under ordinary conditions of
weather. Moreover, though they carried a single sail, they
were not intended to contend with heavy winter weather.</p>

<p>We have a description of the <i>Mont-Joie</i>, in which Louis IX
of France sailed on his last crusade. She was built at Genoa,
which then and for long after shared with Venice the distinction
of being the birthplace of the largest and finest ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the world. She is worth describing, for she was one of the
precursors of the big Spanish and Genoese carracks that our
fleets encountered off the coasts of France and Flanders from
time to time during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and
which stimulated us to buy or build big ships of our own.</p>

<p>The <i>Mont-Joie</i> was 80 feet long on the keel, but over
all, measuring from the extremity of the forecastle to the
highest point of the stern, she had a length of 120 feet. She
is said to have been 26 feet deep amidships. Twelve feet
above the keel was a deck running from right forward to
right aft. Below this was the hold, where lay the ballast,
and in which were stowed water, provisions, and various war
materials. Six feet above the lower deck was another similar
deck, which we may call the upper deck, while above this
again a gallery or gangway, six or seven feet wide, ran along
each side of the ship, between the fore and after castles. The
ship's side rose 3½ feet above these fore and aft bridges and
was pierced with loopholes for archery. In action the bulwarks
would be heightened and further protected by shields
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavises</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Below the upper deck, aft, was situated the
"paradis" (chambre de parade), or state cabin, which in this
case was, of course, occupied by St. Louis himself.</p>

<p>There was other accommodation provided forward for the
rest of the <i>Mont-Joie's</i> passengers, with the exception of the
Queen, who occupied another "paradis" on the upper deck,
immediately over the King's. These cabins were lighted by
ports or scuttles cut in the sides of the ship. Forward there
was further shelter provided under the forecastle, and both
it and the after part of the ship were surmounted by a <em>bellatorium</em>,
or fighting-platform, with bulwarks 4 feet in height.
The ship was equipped with two tall masts raking forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and carrying large lateen sails. At the summit of each was
a <em>gabie</em> or fighting-top. Altogether it will be seen at once
that here was a real sea-going ship, very different from the
open boats, manned by giants, of the seals and manuscripts
illustrations.</p>

<p>It is not always easy to convey the impression of size
by mere figures, but if we bear in mind that the famous
old <i>Victory</i>, now lying in Portsmouth Harbour, and which
many of us have seen at least once, is only about twice the
length of those thirteenth-century ships, we shall be able to
form some idea of their not unimportant dimensions.</p>

<p>Many of the mediæval ships were most gorgeously painted
and decorated. When the French king Charles VI fitted out
a great naval armament at Sluys, in 1386, for the invasion of
England&mdash;which did not come off, by the way&mdash;Froissart tells
us that "gold and silver were no more spared than though
it had rained out of the clouds or been scooped out of the
sea". One young noble covered his mast with gold-leaf.
"They made banners, pennons, and standards of silk, so goodly
that it was marvel to behold them; also they painted the
masts of their ships from the one end to the other, glittering
with gold and devices and arms: and specially it was shewed
me", says old Froissart, "that the Lord Guy de la Tremouille
garnished his ship richly; the paintings that were made cost
more than ten thousand francs. Whatsoever any lord could
devise for their pleasure was made on the ships: and the poor
people of the realm paid for all; for the taxes were so great,
to furnish this voyage, that they which were most rich sorrowed
for it, and the poor fled for it."</p>

<p>Our own Henry V had rather "loud" tastes in his ship
decoration. In the year 1400 he had a ship painted red, decorated
with collars and garters of gold surrounding fleur-de-lis
and leopards, as well as gilded leashes looped round white
greyhounds with golden collars. All these were selections
from the royal badges. Her mast was red also. The <i>Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Pace of the Tower</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was red too, but her upper works and
stern were of a different colour, and she carried a gilded eagle
with a crown in its mouth on her bowsprit.</p>

<p>The <i>Trinity of the Tower</i> was another red ship, elaborately
adorned with coats of arms, while the <i>Nicholas of the Tower</i>
was black, "powdered" with "Prince of Wales's Feathers",
with quills and scrolls in gold. The King's own particular
ship, the "cog" <i>John</i>, carried the royal crest, "the Lion standing
on the Crown", at her masthead, besides other decorations.
The Genoese in 1242 painted their war-ships white, spotted
all over with red crosses, so Henry perhaps only followed
the fashion after all; but, generally speaking, red was the
favourite colour, though black at times ran it pretty close in
favour as groundwork for various patterns of ornamentation.</p>

<p>But the continually growing decoration in the way of
flags, standards, pennons, and streamers must by no means
be overlooked. They were, perhaps, the most striking characteristic
of the mediæval war-ship.</p>

<p>The standard or pennon of the owner or commander of
the ship&mdash;and it must be remembered that he was in those
days not a seaman, but always a soldier&mdash;was planted at the
foremost corner of the poop or after-castle, on the starboard
side. A ship called after a saint would have, in addition,
the banner of that saint, and in the case of the Cinque Ports
we may be sure that their arms, "three lions with half a
galley in place of tail and hind legs", were displayed on
some portion of the vessel. In royal ships there were other
banners with the various royal badges, and there were hosts
of streamers, pendants, and guidons as well. When fully
"dressed", with all her flags flying, the mediæval war-ship
must have made a brave display. Galleys, in addition, had
a small staff with a pendant attached to the loom of every
oar on such occasions.</p>

<div class="caption">Fifteenth-century Ship<br />

<p>Observe the capacious hull, the heavy mast, the way the sail is made fast in the
middle as well as by the sheets at the corners, the crane for hoisting missiles to the top,
and the darts ranged round it; also the way the main-yard is spliced in the middle.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nor must we overlook the ornamental nature of the sails
in the times of which we are writing. It was no uncommon
thing for the whole of the big square mainsail of a "cog"
to be decorated with the arms of her owner. This is clearly
shown in the well-known manuscript <cite>Life of the Earl of
Warwick</cite>, by John Rous. Generally sails, often themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the richest colouring and material, were adorned with
badges or devices, but sometimes merely with stripes of different
colours. Colour ran riot in the war-vessels of our
mediæval ancestors&mdash;how different from the sombre grey war-paint
of our modern Leviathans!</p>

<p>Note the diminutive figure-head, the two shields amidships&mdash;probably placed there
for decorative purposes, as the ship appears to be &quot;dressed&quot; with many pennons and
streamers. The smallness of the tops is unusual, also the square port-hole and the
double-gabled cabin.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The end of the fifteenth century saw the development
of the carrack into the caravel, such a ship as the <i>Sancta
Maria</i>, in which Columbus sailed to the West Indies in 1492.
As her original plans were found in the dockyard at Cadiz,
and a replica of the famous original was built from them by
Spanish workmen in the arsenal of Carracas in 1892 for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Chicago Exhibition, which took place in the following year,
we know exactly what she was like. She was just over
60 feet long on her keel, and had a length over all of 93 feet,
with a beam of nearly 6 feet. She had a displacement of
233 tons when fully laden and equipped. She had three
masts, but only the mainmast had a top-sail. The mizzen
carried a lateen sail. She was considerably smaller than
many ships of her day, but in general appearance and rig she
approximated to the smaller ships of the Elizabethan epoch,
and she and her class may well be considered as forming a
connecting-link between the old single-masted "round ships"
and the square-rigged, many-gunned line-of-battleship, which
from the time of Henry VIII to Queen Victoria formed the
mainstay of our battle fleets. There were, of course, many
developments and improvements during this long period, but
the type persisted throughout, just as did that of the modified
Viking ship in mediæval ages.</p>

<p>So much for the ships of the Middle Ages. But before
we go on to take stock of their crews it will be as well
to attempt some description of the way they were fought.
Nowadays the ship armed with the heaviest and longest-ranged
guns&mdash;if her gunners know their work&mdash;seems to
be able to "knock out" a slightly less powerfully gunned
opponent before she can get in any effective reply. The
present war has given us many illustrations of this fact.
The <i>Scharnhorst</i>&mdash;a crack gunnery ship&mdash;with her heavier
broadside, was able to sink the <i>Good Hope</i> with little or no
damage to herself, and in her turn she was simply demolished
by the heavy guns of the <i>Inflexible</i> and the <i>Invincible</i>
off the Falkland Islands.</p>

<p>But in the Middle Ages there was nothing like this. All
decisive fighting was practically hand to hand and man to
man, except for the use of the ram by galleys and the exchange
of arrows and stones at comparatively close quarters.
But victory was only achieved, as a general rule, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
enemy's ship was boarded and her crew defeated in a bloody
tussle, at the end of which no one but the victors remained
alive, unless, perhaps, some knight or noble who was worth
preserving for the value of his ransom. The military portion
of the crew, the archers, men-at-arms, and their knightly
leaders, carried the usual arms of their day. The seamen,
who were in the minority, probably used knives, short swords,
and spears, and made themselves very useful in hurling big
stones, heavy javelins called "viretons", unslaked lime, and
other disagreeable missiles from the "top-castles" at the head
of the mast or masts.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the fore and after fighting-stages,
or, as they later on became, poops and forecastles,
that were erected when a ship was going on the war-path.
We may note, in passing, that in the earlier part of the period
we are dealing with, these were so often and so generally
required that "castle-building" afloat became a recognized
trade, until, in the process of evolution, poops and forecastles
became integral parts of the ship.</p>

<p>We may add that, in addition to the fore and after fighting-platforms,
special fighting-towers were not infrequently
erected, certainly in the Mediterranean, and we may therefore
assume that they were not altogether unknown in Northern
waters. These towers were generally built up round the
mast, and provided with loopholes and battlements, and sometimes
protected by iron plates or raw hides.</p>

<p>One account of mediæval war-galleys states that in some
cases "a castle was erected of the width of the ship and
some twenty feet in length; its platform being elevated
sufficiently to allow of free passage under it and over the
benches". King John introduced the famous Genoese cross-bowmen&mdash;who
so signally failed to distinguish themselves
at Crécy&mdash;into his navy. The reason most probably was
that a cross-bow could be fired through a loophole by a
man crouching under cover of the bulwarks or shield-row,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
whereas a long-bow could not be used in this way. Nevertheless
the cross-bow did not succeed in ousting the long-bow
in the British Navy, since, in 1456, in the course of
a public disputation between the heralds of England and
France as to the claim of the former country to the domination
of the sea, the French herald claimed for his countrymen
that they were more formidable afloat because they
used the cross-bow. "Our arbalistiers", he asserted, "fire
under cover or from the shelter of the fore and after castles;
through little loopholes they strike their opponents without
danger of being wounded themselves. Your English archers,
on the other hand, cannot let fly their arrows except above-board
and standing clear of cover; fear and the motion of
the ship is likely to distract their aim." But there does not
seem to have been much "fear" among the English archers,
and as those that were in the habit of serving afloat doubtless
had their "sea-legs", it must have taken a good deal to
disconcert their aim, world-renowned for its deadliness.</p>

<p>Still, as we shall see in a later chapter, the cross-bow
was a most formidable weapon afloat, and the French herald's
argument was a sound one. In the place of artillery the
ships of the earlier Middle Ages were provided with mangonels,
trebuchets, espringalds and other mechanical instruments
for hurling heavy projectiles, which, according to
some authorities, were made or imported as the result of
the experiences of Richard I and his crusading companions
in the Mediterranean. Personally, I should say that they
had been known long before that time. A contemporary
chronicle of the siege of Paris by the Northmen in 885-7
mentions that, to cover the Danish stormers, "thousands of
leaden balls, scattered like a thick hail in the air, fall upon
the city, and powerful <em>catapults</em> thunder upon the forts
which defend the bridge". The knowledge of the heavy
war-machines of the Ancients had never died out. The
catapult was the old Roman onager, and consisted of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
long arm or beam, of which one end was thrust through the
middle of a tightly-twisted bundle of hair-ropes, fibres, or
sinews stretched across a solid frame. At the other end
was either a sling or a spoon-shaped receptacle for the projectile.
This end was drawn back by means of levers and
winches against the twist of the bundle of sinews and held by
a catch. On the catch being released, by pulling on a lanyard
attached to a trigger, the long end of the beam was forced
violently forward till it struck against a strongly-supported
transverse baulk of timber arranged for the purpose. When
this occurred the huge stone or other projectile flew on
through the air and struck its target with tremendous force.</p>

<p>The trebuchet and the mangonel were very like the Roman
ballista, and acted much in the same way as the catapult, except
that the motive force was the fall of a heavy counterweight
instead of tension. The springald, or espringald, was
a large-sized steel cross-bow, mounted on a pivot, hurling
heavy iron darts, with great force, which had considerable
penetration. In the battle of Zierksee (1304) one of these
heavy "garots", as they were called, struck the <i>Orgueileuse</i>
of Bruges with such violence that it not only pierced the bulwarks
of the forecastle, but took off the arm of one of the
trumpeters who were sounding their silver trumpets, transfixed
another, and finally embedded itself in the after castle.</p>

<p>One of the most formidable missiles hurled by the mangonels
and such machines was the famous Greek fire,
knowledge of which had been brought to Europe from the
Crusades. Sometimes it was projected through "siphons"
or tubes, of which no exact knowledge has come down to
us. But it seems to have ignited the moment it came in
contact with the air, and was spouted forth with the violence
of water from a fire-hose. It destroyed everything that came
in its way, and was inextinguishable by water. It could only
be smothered by plenty of earth or sand, a material not generally
available at sea. The mangonels threw it in barrels.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"This was the fashion of the Greek Fire," says De Joinville,
the historian of Louis IX's first Crusade. "It came on as broad
in front as a vinegar cask, and the tail of fire that trailed behind
it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it
came, that it sounded like the thunder of Heaven. It looked
like a dragon in the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that
one could see all over the camp as though it was day, by
reason of the great mass of fire and the brilliance of the light
that it shed. Thrice that night they hurled the Greek Fire
at us, and four times shot it from the tourniquet<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> cross-bow.
Every time that our holy King (St. Louis) heard that they
were throwing Greek Fire at us, he draped his sheet round
him, and stretched out his hands to our Lord, and said, weeping:
'Oh! fair Lord God, protect my people!'" Such was the
terror inspired by this fearful mixture, whose chief ingredient
is supposed to have been naphtha. It does not, however, appear
to have been used to any considerable extent in Western
Europe.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the period we are dealing with, cannon&mdash;big,
little, and middle-sized&mdash;quite superseded the mangonel
and other mechanical projectile-throwers. Few large guns
were carried, and those mostly fixed rigidly on timber beds
and fired over the ship's side&mdash;hence the term "gunwale",
which we still use in boats, a "wale" meaning a band of
timber. Small breech-loading guns were mounted in considerable
numbers in the fore and after castles, some of these,
generally known as "murderers", being mounted inboard in
such a way as to fire at close quarters on any boarding-parties
of the enemy who might succeed in gaining possession of the
waist of the ship. Others were mounted aloft in the tops,
just as they were in our own days until the tops were required
for fire-control platforms. But I propose to give the quaint
ancestors of our modern monster cannon and rapid-fire guns
a chapter to themselves later on.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> have yet to give some descriptions of one or two actual
battles, but I think we will commence by trying to picture the
seamen themselves.</div>

<p>What were these old "matlows"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> like, and how were they
raised? The second question is easily answered. As Lord
Haldane has stated, compulsory service was never foreign to
the English laws and constitution. But we may observe that
it has never been carried out in the fair and impartial manner
which is now universal on the Continent of Europe, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
"duke's son, cook's son", and everybody else has to serve his
country alike. No; ours has always been a kind of bullying
system or want of system.</p>

<p>In the old days of the Cinque Ports, if more ships were
required than they had to provide, their ships were just sent
out to "commandeer" any suitable craft they could lay hands
on. So with men. Certain places and counties had to provide
a regulated quota of soldiers or sailors, or both. If they were
voluntarily forthcoming, well and good; if not, the magistrates,
the port-reeves, or bayliffs had authority to take as
many as they required to make up the number by force, and
made no bones about doing so. So while Jones got off free,
Brown and Robinson were pressed. But it was all a matter
of luck&mdash;at any rate ostensibly. That was the hardship of it,
not only then, but in the later "press-gang days".</p>

<p>But, once caught, the mediæval seaman had little to complain
of in the way of pay. That, no doubt, made up for a
good deal of severe discomfort. A mariner or seaman in 1277
got 3<i>d.</i> a day&mdash;a penny more than an ordinary soldier<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;and
in 1370 it was raised to 4<i>d.</i> Now, if we bear in mind that
it has been estimated that money at that time was worth
something like fourteen times what it is to-day, we must
admit that the seaman did not do so badly. The master
of the ship at this time was called the "rector", and received
6<i>d.</i> a day, while his second in command got the same amount.
There were no admirals then, but the senior sea officer of the
fleet was termed "captain" and paid 12<i>d.</i> per diem. The
knight who was in actual military command of a warship
would draw 2<i>s.</i> a day if he was paid the same rate afloat as
ashore.</p>

<p>Whether there was a regular scale of provisioning before
John Redynge was appointed "Clerk of the Spicery" in 1496,
to look after the victualling of both army and navy, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
unable to say, but it appears that the usual "sea-stock" laid
in for a voyage in mediæval times consisted of bacon, salt
meat, "Poor John" or salted herrings, flour, eggs, and poultry.</p>

<p>We have little information as to the personality, manners,
and customs of the seamen of mediæval ages. In the earlier
period they were pretty certainly more of the long-shore or
fisherman class than deep-sea sailors. When not engaged in
legitimate trading or warfare they generally took a hand
at rank piracy. There was a saying about them that the
British sailors were "good seamen, but better pirates"! Even
the Cinque Ports, which provided the nearest approach to a
national navy, achieved a most scandalous notoriety in this
respect. But at the same time there is no doubt that the
Normans, Basques, Flemings, French, and other seafarers were
just as bad, though perhaps not quite so expert. It was the
fashion afloat in those days.</p>

<p>We may gather some small idea of what seamen and sea-going
were like in the Middle Ages from the pen of one
Brother Felix Fabri, a Dominican of Ulm, who went from
Venice to Jerusalem somewhere about 1480. Space forbids
as long an extract as could be wished, for his experiences are
both interesting and amusing. The seamen with whom he
came in contact were not Englishmen, but "sea ways" are
generally much the same all over the world. He and his
fellow pilgrims chose their berths before starting, and had
their names chalked over them. He gives many warnings,
which those of us who have been to sea can well appreciate.
To the would-be traveller he says: "Let him not sit on any
ropes, lest the wind change of a sudden and he be thrown
overboard". And "Let him beware of getting in the way
of the crew, for however noble he may be, nay, were he a
bishop, they will push against him and trample on him". "He
should also be cautious where he sits down, lest he stick to his
seat, for every place is covered with pitch, which becomes
soft in the heat of the sun". Inadvertently to "steal the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
commander's paint" is a mishap which may easily overtake
the unwary on board His Majesty's ships in these latter days.</p>

<p>The chronicler explains that the captain's authority is
absolute; though ignorant of navigation, he commands what
course the ship will take. He has under him a master-at-arms,
a "caliph" or "ship's husband", and a "cometa" or
"mate", who sets the crew in motion&mdash;like the commander
in a modern man-of-war. "The mate's subordinates", says
Brother Felix, "fear him as they would fear the devil." The
crew&mdash;bar the wretched slaves who worked the oars, and of
whose tortures "he shuddered to think"&mdash;consisted of "compani",
nine in number, who were employed on all dangerous
work aloft, and others termed "mariners", who, according
to him, "sing while work is being carried on to those who
do it". This sounds like a "soft job", but the "mariners"
probably may be classed with the so-called "idlers" in our
war-ships, who are anything but idle. There was a "scribe",
with the duties of the purser on a mail steamer of our day,
who "arranges disputes about berths, makes men pay their
passage-money, and has many duties. He is, as a rule, hated
by all alike." We must not omit mention of the pilot, or
navigating officer, with whom were associated "certain cunning
men, astrologers and soothsayers, who watch the signs
of the stars and the sky". They have a chart, "an ell long
and an ell broad, whereon the whole sea is drawn with
thousands of lines". One of them was always on duty,
watching the compass and chanting "a kind of sweet song,
which shows that all is going well, and in the same tone he
chants to him that holdeth the tiller of the rudder, to which
quarter it ought to be moved".</p>

<p>The mention of "astrologers and soothsayers" reminds
us that sailors have always had the reputation of being exceptionally
superstitious. I doubt if this is still true&mdash;at any
rate as regards the Royal Navy. Take the proverbial bad
luck of sailing on a Friday. My own sea experience, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
goes back for a good many years, is that Friday was a very
favourite day for going to sea. We often left harbour on
Fridays. I think it was because on Saturday we got a good
clear day for cleaning up the ship, then came Sunday&mdash;a quiet
day&mdash;so that everything and everybody was nicely settled
down by Monday morning, and we could start fair on the
weekly routine.</p>

<p>But from what we know of life in the Middle Ages it
would have been indeed strange if seamen had <em>not</em> been superstitious.
The wonders and dangers of the deep were very
real and close in those days of cogs and galleys&mdash;veritably
mere specks on the ocean. It is to be feared that seamen
of later ages had not the same dread of going to sea in
debt as De Joinville the Crusader,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or the expression "to pay
with the fore-topsail" would never have arisen. Like Chaucer's
seaman, some of them "of nice conscience took .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no keep",
and were very glad to escape their creditors by hoisting sail
and putting to sea.</p>

<p>"Sailors have ever been superstitious," says a French
writer on the Middle Ages;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "their credulous brains are the
parents of all the fantastic beings and animals that they persuade
themselves that they have seen in their wanderings,
and with which they have peopled the mysterious depths of
the ocean. The syrens of antiquity, the monsters of Scylla
and Charybdis, have been far surpassed by modern legendary
creations, such as the 'Kraken', a gigantic mass of pulp
which attacked and dragged down the largest ships; the
'Bishop Fish', which, mitre on head, blessed and then devoured
shipwrecked mariners; the 'Black Hand', which, even
in the days of Columbus, was despicted as marking the entrance
to the 'Sunless Ocean'; and the numerous troops
of hideous demons, one of whom, in the sight of the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
French Fleet of Crusaders, on their way to attack the Island
of Mitylene, in the reign of Louis XII, clutched and swallowed
up a profligate sailor who had 'blasphemed and defied the
Holy Virgin'."</p>

<p>Strange to say, the St. Elmo's light, or "corposant", was
regarded as a heaven-sent vision prognosticating favour and
protection. Knowing nothing of electricity, and being unaware
that the gradual collection of the electric fluid into the
weird luminous balls of light which, during thunderstorms,
sometimes collect at mast-head or yard-arm, is supposed to
render the ship less likely to be struck by lightning, one
cannot help thinking it remarkable that this phenomenon,
which certainly has quite a supernatural appearance, did not
inspire more terror than confidence in the seamen of the Middle
Ages. I remember two "corposants" appearing at the fore-top-mast
head and at the yard-arm on board the old <i>Nelson</i>
in a storm of thunder and wind, off the Australian coast.
They remained&mdash;occasionally shifting their position a little&mdash;for
some considerable time.</p>

<p>It was doubtless something of this kind which William,
Earl of Salisbury, saw one night, in a hard gale of wind, on
his way back from the Holy Land in 1222. The storm was
so fierce that he gave up hope of life, and threw his money
and richest apparel overboard. Suddenly, when the tempest
was at its height, all hands saw "a mighty taper of wax burning
brightly at the prow". They also thought they saw the
figure of a celestial being standing beside it, screening it from
the wind. The ship's company were at once reassured of
ultimate safety, but the Earl was the most confident of all,
because he felt certain that he was being repaid for his piety
at the time of his initiation into the honour of knighthood,
on which occasion he had brought a taper to the altar, and
arranged for it to be lighted every day in honour of the Holy
Virgin.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 6em;"><span class="smcap">Peter of Langtoft</span> (modernized), thirteenth-century poem.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most interesting episodes of mediæval war afloat
was the sinking of the great Turkish <i>Dromon</i>, off Beyrout, by
King Richard I. After having effected the junction of his
fleets off Messina, he had gone on to Cyprus, where fighting,
and other matters with which we need not concern ourselves,
had delayed him for some time. At length he and his "busses"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and galleys set out for Acre. The following day&mdash;6th June,
1191&mdash;the British fleet made the Syrian coast, near the Castle
of Margat, and continued their way, pretty close under the
land, for the town of Acre. About noon the day following,
when near Beyrout, it was reported to the King, who led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fleet in his galley <i>Trench-the-Mer</i>, that an enormous ship was
in sight. None of the English had ever seen such a leviathan.
"A marvellous ship," says an old chronicler, "a ship than
which, except Noah's ship, none greater was ever read of&mdash;the
Queen of Ships!" It was a fine and beautiful summer
morning, with but little wind. The strange ship showed no
distinguishing colours, and was putting on as much sail as
she possibly could; but she made little, if any, way at all:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"The weather was full soft, the wind held them still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sail was high aloft, they had no wind at will",</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>to quote an ancient poem dealing with the fight that ensued.
The big ship was of great bulk, painted green on one side and
yellow on the other, probably to render her inconspicuous
against either a sandy or a green background, or at sea, when
her green side was towards the enemy. But in spite of this
curious colouring she is said to have presented a very beautiful
appearance, and her decoration was considered "very
elegant".</div>

<p>The vessel is stated to have carried 1500 men&mdash;an enormous
complement&mdash;which included 7 Emirs and 80 chosen
Turks, for the defence of Acre. She was equipped with bows,
arrows, and other weapons, many jars filled with the dreaded
Greek fire, and "200 most deadly serpents prepared for the
destruction of Christians". Most historians consider that
these "serpents" were some kind of firework used as a missile,
since "serpentine" was an early name for one of the smallest-sized
cannon. Personally, I do not see why we should not
accept the word "serpents" in its everyday meaning. The
adjective "deadly" is suggestive, and in one old account it
is particularly stated that "the 200 serpents were <em>drowned</em>".
There have been instances of hives of bees being hurled as
missiles from war-engines, so why not baskets of deadly
snakes? But it is more probable that these serpents&mdash;since
none of them were expended in the battle that took place&mdash;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
intended to have been introduced into the camps of the
Crusaders after being landed at Acre.</p>

<p>As soon as the big <i>Dromon</i>&mdash;as she is generally called by
old writers&mdash;was sighted, Richard dispatched Peter de Barris
in his galley to find out who she was. The word <i>Dromon</i>, by
the way, was used at that time to denote any exceptionally
large ship; just as we use "Dreadnought" in a similar way.
But the actual and original meaning of the word was not a
big, but a fast, ship. The word is connected with speed and
racing, and is of Greek origin. We use it in its proper sense
now in hippodrome, velodrome, aerodrome, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As De Barris pulled alongside the <i>Dromon</i>, she showed the
French king's colours on a lance, and, on being hailed, stated
that she was taking French Crusaders to Acre. Further interrogated,
another story was tried. She was a Genoese,
bound for Tyre. All this was suspicious enough, but in the
meantime one of the men in the King's ship announced that
he recognized her&mdash;he had seen her once at Beyrout&mdash;and was
brought before Richard. "I will give my head to be cut off,
or myself to be hanged," asserted this mariner, "if I do not
prove that this is a Saracen ship. Let a galley be sent after
them, and give them no salutation; their intention and trustworthiness
will then be discovered." Richard adopted the
suggestion. Another galley shot out from the fleet and surged
up alongside the towering <i>Dromon</i>. There was no mistake
this time. Down came whistling flights of arrows, while pots
of Greek fire crashed into flame as they struck the galley.
Off dashed Richard in the <i>Trench-the-Mer</i> to the rescue.
"Follow me, and take them," he cried to the other galleys,
"for if they escape, ye lose my love for ever; and if ye capture
them all their goods shall be yours!" The Turk could not get
away, she was practically becalmed, and the oar-propelled
galleys of the Crusaders closed around her.</p>

<p>But the assailants were in the same predicament as were
the Romans when they attacked the lofty ships of the Veneti.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The sides of the <i>Dromon</i> towered far over their heads, and do
what they would they could not get on board her. The Turks
had thrown a grapnel and made fast to the King's galley at
the very beginning of the fight. Greek fire and missiles of
all kinds rained upon the heads of the English, fully exposed
on the decks and benches of their low galleys. The apparent
hopelessness of their situation began to affect the efforts of
the Crusaders. Richard saw that "something must be done",
and he rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>"Will ye now suffer that ship to get off untouched and
uninjured?" he shouted. "Oh, shame! after so many triumphs
do ye now give way to sloth and fear? Know that if this
ship escape, every one of you shall be hung on the cross or
put to extreme torture!"</p>

<p>That was <em>his</em> way of bestowing the cross&mdash;a wooden one,
not an "iron" one! But it had its effect. The galley-men
dived overboard, and, fastening ropes to the enemy's rudder,
"steered her as they pleased". It is rather difficult to understand
the precise advantage gained by his man&#339;uvre, unless
the wind had sprung up and the big Turkish vessel was
gathering a good deal of way and dragging the whole press
of galleys along with her, and that many were in danger of
being swamped. However, after this they were able to climb
up her sides by means of ropes, and a desperate hand-to-hand
conflict took place on her decks. Here the martial prowess of
the Crusaders had full play. Wielding their heavy trenchant
swords, they drove the Saracens right forward into the bows
of the ship; but just when they thought victory was in their
grasp, up came a torrent of fresh assailants from below, and in
such overwhelming numbers that the boarders were hurled back
into their galleys.</p>

<p>Things were now very black indeed, but Richard once
more showed his generalship. He ordered the whole of his
galleys to cut loose from their elephantine enemy, to draw off
and form line abreast with their bows towards the foe. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
at his signal, down went the long oars with a great splash
into the water, and, every rower putting his full strength into
his stroke, the galleys roared through the sea at the big yellow
and green <i>Dromon</i>. There was a series of rending crashes as
the iron beaks of the galleys struck her sides, like sword-fish
attacking a whale. The Crusaders backed their oars for all
they knew, to get clear, and, staggering and rolling to her
doom, the huge Saracen gradually foundered as the water
poured in cataracts through the gaping holes in her sides.
Only fifty-five of her crew were saved, being men whom the
Crusaders considered would be useful to help them to make
the military engines, for which, it would seem, the Saracens
were renowned. The remainder who had escaped the swords
of the English were "sent home by water", according to the
custom of Chaucer's "schipman" at a later date. This cruel
habit would seem to have died hard, for we find one of the
English captains in the Armada fight regretting that they
had not "made water-spaniels" of the crew of a captured
Spaniard who were reported to be short of provisions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will now forge right ahead through a couple of hundred
years, and take a glimpse at a sea-fight in the days of
Richard II. The merchants of Flanders, La Rochelle, and
some other places had agreed to sail together in considerable
force for mutual protection to La Rochelle, in order to buy
wine and other merchandise. The English had wind of this
expedition and had every intention of catching them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i>. But the Flemings contrived to elude them and get
safely to their destination. There was nothing for it but
to make another attempt, and cut them off on their return
journey.</p>

<p>"The English navy", says Sir John Froissart, "lay at
anchor before Margate at the Thames mouth, toward Sandwich,
abiding their adventure, and specially abiding for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ships that were gone to La Rochelle; for they thought they
would shortly return. And so they did.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>When he saw he would have to fight, Sir John de Bucq,
the commander of the Flemings, made ready his 700 cross-bowmen
and his guns.</p>

<p>"The English ships approached," continues Froissart, "and
they had certain galleys furnished with archers, and these
came foremost rowing with oars, and gave the first assault.
The archers shot fiercely, and lost much of their shot; for the
Flemings covered them under the decks and would not appear,
but drave ever forward with the wind: and when they were
out of the English archer's shot, then they did let fly their bolts
from the cross-bows, wherewith they hurted many.</p>

<p>"Then approached the great ships of England, the Earl of
Arundel with his company, and the Bishop of Norwich with
his; and so the other lords. They rushed in among the
Flemings' ships, and them of La Rochelle: yet the Flemings
and cross-bows defended themselves right valiantly, for their
patron, Sir John de Bucq, did ever support them: he was in
a great strong ship, where he had three guns shooting so
great stones, that wheresoever they lighted they did great
damage. And even as they fought they drew little and little
towards Flanders; and some little ships, with their merchants,
took the coasts of Flanders, and the low water, and thereby
saved them, for the great ships could not follow them.</p>

<p>"Thus on the sea they had a hard battle, and ships broken
and sunken on both sides; for out of the tops they cast down
great bars of iron, sharpened so that they went through to
the bottom. This was a hard battle and well fought, for it
endured three whole tides; and when the day failed they
withdrew from each other, and cast anchor, and there rested
all night, and there dressed their hurt men: and when the
flood came, they disanchored and drew up sails and returned
again to battle.</p>

<p>"With the Englishmen was Peter du Bois of Ghent, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
certain archers and mariners; he gave the Flemings much
ado, for he had been a mariner, therefore he knew the art of
the sea, and he was sore displeased that the Flemings and
merchants endured so long. But always the Englishmen won
advantage of the Flemings, and so came between Blankenburgh
and Sluys, against Cadsand; there was the discomfiture, for
the Flemings were not succoured by any creature; and also at
that time there were no ships at Sluys, nor men of war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
By this discomfiture of Sir John de Bucq, as he came from La
Rochelle, the Englishmen had great profit, specially of wine,
for they had a nine thousand tuns of wine; whereby wine was
the dearer all the year after in Flanders, Holland, and Brabant,
and the better cheap in England, as it was reason. Such are
the chances of this world; if one hath damage another hath
profit."</p>

<p>There are one or two very interesting points in this
account. One, of course, is the fact that there were three
guns mounted on John de Bucq's ship, which evidently was
exceptional at the time, or attention would not have been so
particularly drawn to them. Moreover, they were not little
guns, like those which were mounted in such numbers a few
years later, but of some size, since they fired "<em>great</em> stones".
But the most noteworthy point that emerges from the story
of the fight is that not only were the cross-bowmen able to
fire from under cover on the English without exposing themselves,
but their bows had actually outranged the long-bows.
Now we know that a long-bow in expert hands would kill at
400 yards, so that the effective range of the cross-bow must
have been considerable.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">"The Building of the Ship." <span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Tudor period, to which this chapter is devoted, is noteworthy
as witnessing the birth of the Royal Navy as a permanent
national institution. Though we have accounts&mdash;probably
to a great extent mythical&mdash;of the 3600 "very
stout" ships of the Saxon King Edgar (<span class='small'>A.D.</span> 975), which are
said to have been divided into three squadrons, cruising on
the north, east, and west coasts of Great Britain; though
Edward III, after the victory over the French at Sluys, was
dubbed "King of the Sea"; and though Henry V got together
the most formidable navy of his time, yet at none of these
periods was there what we may term a navy of the realm.
Indeed, for the two years, August, 1447, to August, 1449,
there may be said to have been no navy at all, since during
the whole of this time only £8, 9<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> was expended upon
what we now regard as our first line of defence.</div>

<p>At the death of Henry V, in 1422, the "Little Navy"
disease broke out again, and nearly the whole of his fine
fleet was sold. Things went from bad to worse, till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
disgust and uneasiness of the nation found expression in
a little work entitled <cite>The Libel of English Policie</cite>. The
author, who is supposed to have been Bishop Adam de Molyns,
exhorted the nation to "Keepe the Sea and namely the Narrow
Sea", and also to secure both Dover and Calais. "Where
bene our shippes", says he, "where bene our swerdes become?"
He went on to point out how much our naval force
had deteriorated since the time when Edward III had caused
the famous Golden Noble to be struck, in which he is represented
standing in a ship, sword in hand and shield on arm,
and thus referred to the signification of the device:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Four things our Noble sheweth unto me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">King, Ship and Sword and Power of the Sea".</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>That this appeal had some kind of effect is shown by the fact
that in 1442 an order was issued "for to have upon the See
continuelly, for the sesons of the yere fro Candlimes to Martymesse,
viii Shippes with forstages; ye wiche Shippes, as it
is thought, most have on with an other eche of hem cl men.
Item, every grete Shippe most have attendyng opon hym a
Barge and a Balynger." "Hym" strikes one, by the way, as
a curious way to refer to a ship. These vessels with "iiii
Spynes", which seem to have been what we might call dispatch
vessels, were stationed, one at Bristol, two at Dartmouth, two
in the Thames, one at Hull, and one at "the Newe Castell".
The whole fleet combined was manned by 2160 men. It was
a poor affair, but still it was better than nothing.</div>

<p>Then came the Wars of the Roses, which, naturally,
diverted men's thoughts from the navy. That Edward IV,
when he had established himself on the throne, had some idea
of emulating the naval deeds of the third Edward may be
suspected from his having issued a gold noble, which was
evidently closely copied from the one we have already referred
to. But nothing much was done either by him or by his successor,
Richard Crookback, and it was left to Henry VII to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
reap the honour of being, to some extent, the founder of the
Royal Navy of which we are all so proud. Though by some
his son, "Bluff King Hal", may be regarded in this light,
on account of the very formidable fleet which he raised and
organized and the improvements which he is said to have
made in its ships, yet I think we must admit that Henry VII
laid the foundation-stone upon which his successor built.</p>

<p>He depended greatly on hired merchantmen&mdash;we do not
despise this method of augmenting our navy even at the
present day&mdash;but he resurrected the Royal Fleet. Though
it was but a very small one, of only about a dozen ships, yet
two of them, at any rate, were finer ships than any the British
Navy had before possessed. These were the <i>Regent</i> and the
<i>Sovereign</i>. While we had neglected our shipbuilding, to carry
on war between ourselves, it had progressed abroad, especially
in France, and there is little doubt that the <i>Regent</i>, built on
the River Rother, was inspired by the French ship <i>Columbe</i>,
which, perhaps, was the ship which had brought Henry to
England. The <i>Regent</i> had four masts, the <i>Sovereign</i> three,
and each of them was much more like some of the ships we
are familiar with in pictures of the Spanish Armada fight than
the old cogs of a few years previously, even in their most improved
forms. The armament of the <i>Regent</i> consisted, it is
said, of 225 "serpentines". The number is formidable, but
not the weapons themselves. They were merely what might
be called breech-loading wall-pieces, corresponding to Chinese
"jingalls", and firing balls weighing from 4 to 6 ounces.</p>

<p>In a contemporary picture of the destruction of this ship
in her action with the <i>Marie la Cordelière</i> in 1512, when both
ships caught fire and blew up, the <i>Regent</i> is shown with very
heavy guns firing through port-holes. Port-holes, by the way,
are said to have been invented by Desharges, a Brest shipbuilder,
in 1500. I am inclined to think that they were known at
an earlier date&mdash;possibly Desharges invented port-<em>lids</em>. It
is, of course, possible that these were cut in the <i>Regent</i> some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
time after her original construction, and heavier guns mounted
in place of some of her serpentines. According to some writers
this ship was originally christened the <i>Great Harry</i>, while
the <i>Sovereign</i> was built out of the remains of an older ship
called the <i>Grace Dieu</i>. As a very large and renowned <i>Henri
Grace à Dieu</i> was launched in 1514, there has been a considerable
amount of confusion between one ship and the other.
But if the <i>Regent</i> was called the <i>Great Harry</i>, she had nothing
whatever to do with the <i>Henri</i>, which is also sometimes referred
to as the <i>Harry Grace à Dieu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> As a matter of fact,
the latter was built to replace the former, the loss of which
was considered a national disaster, and so much so that an
attempt was made to keep her fate a secret. "At the reverens
of God", wrote Cardinal Wolsey, "kepe these tydyngs to
yourselfe." There was probably another reason for the construction
of an exceptionally fine ship, and that was the
desire that the English should not be eclipsed by the Scots
in this respect.</p>

<span class="caption">THE <i>GREAT HARRY</i>, THE FIRST BIG BATTLESHIP OF
THE BRITISH NAVY</span>
</div>

<p>For, the year before the <i>Regent</i> was blown up, the King
of Scotland, who was hand in glove with the French, had
put afloat what a contemporary chronicler terms "ane verrie
monstrous great schip". This was the famous <i>Great Michael</i>.
Her constructor was Jaques Tarret, a Frenchman, and it has
been written that "she was of so great stature and took so
much timber, that except Falkland, she wasted all the woods
of Fife, which were oak wood, with all the timber that was
gotten out of Norway". She took "a year and a day to
build", and we are given her dimensions, which compare
favourably in point of size with many much later line-of-battle
ships. "She was 12 score feet in length and 36 feet
within the sides; she was 10 feet thick in the wall, and
boarded on every side so slack and so thick that no cannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
could go through her." It is rather difficult to understand
what "slack" means in this context.</p>

<p>"This great ship", goes on the account, "cumbered Scotland
to get her to sea." By the time she was afloat and fully
equipped she was reckoned to have cost the King from thirty
to forty thousand pounds. She carried a heavy battery, and
if her cannon were as formidable as their names, they must
have been most effective in action. "She bore many cannons,
six on every side, with three great Bassils, two behind in her
dock, and one before, with three hundred shot of small Artillerie,
that is to say, Myand and Battered Falcon and Quarter
Falcon, Slings, pestilent Serpentines and Double Dogs, with
Hagtar and Culvering, Cross-bows and Hand-bows. She had
three hundred mariners to sail her: she had six score of gunners
to use her artillery, and had a thousand men of war by her,
Captains, Skippers, and Quartermasters." A "basil" or "basilisk",
it may be explained, was a gun throwing a ball of 200
pounds weight, a much heavier projectile than any used at
Trafalgar.</p>

<p>Space forbids further details as to the "menagerie" of
other pieces that armed the decks of the <i>Great Michael</i>, but
you will find more about these and other old-fashioned cannon
in another chapter. As soon as she was afloat the King had
her fired at to test the resistance of her tremendously thick
sides, but, says our old writer, "the cannon deired hir not";
that is to say, could not penetrate her. This is the oldest
experiment of the kind of which we have any record. But
the most remarkable thing about the <i>Great Michael</i>&mdash;at least
to my mind&mdash;is her size. According to the old account from
which I have quoted, which, by the way, was written by one
Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, she must have had almost the
exact dimensions of the <i>Duke of Wellington</i>, one of the last
and finest of our steam three-deckers. Now I have a perfect
idea of <em>her</em> size, because I had the honour of serving on board
her for a couple of years. She was in the "sere and yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
leaf" then, her masts had gone, her engines had disappeared,
and she had a roof which made her look much more like
Noah's Ark than a battleship, but I can remember her in
all her glory when she carried the flag of the commander-in-chief
at Portsmouth. I was only a boy then, but I recollect
that her appearance was fine in the extreme. In reckoning
the beam of the <i>Great Michael</i> we must remember to add
20 feet for the thickness of her sides, since Pitscottie only
gives us her internal width. Having done this, I will put
down the dimensions of the two ships for comparison&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Great Michael</i>, length, 240 feet; beam, 56 feet.<br />
<i>Duke of Wellington</i>, length, 240 feet, 7 inches; beam, 60 feet, 1 inch.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Now if Pitscottie's figures are correct, either the <i>Michael</i> must
have been almost incredibly bigger than any ship of her day,
or, as I have before suggested, the old war-ships of that and
earlier centuries were in reality a good deal larger than contemporary
representations and records of "tunnage" would
lead us to expect.</div>

<p>The old Scots writer, however, offers to prove his figures;
for he says: "If any man believe that this ship was not as we
have shewn, let him pass to the place of Tullibardine, where
he will find the length and breadth of her set with hawthorne:
as for my author he was Captain Andrew Wood, principal Captain
of hir, and Robert Bartone, who was made her Skipper".</p>

</div>

<p>With regard to the plan of the vessel in hawthorns, I
am indebted to Lady Strathallan for the following interesting
items: Tullibardine Castle has quite disappeared. What
little was left of it was used in the construction of farm
buildings from 1830-40. The spot where the hawthorns
were planted to show the dimensions of the <i>Great Michael</i>
is still known, but there is nothing to mark it. When the
great ship was built, the carpenter or "wright" of the castle
went down to superintend the shipwrights. When he got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
home, as the people at the castle were very anxious to form
some idea of the size of this "Dreadnought" of that period,
he was given orders to have an excavation made of the exact
size of the ship. The hawthorns were, it would appear,
planted round the excavation, which was tilled with water
and aquatic plants, and remained as an ornamental pond till
about the time of the battle of Waterloo. In 1837 the shape
of the vessel was distinctly perceptible, but three only remained
of the hawthorn-trees that formerly surrounded it.
Some time ago Lady Strathallan, anxious that this curious
monument of antiquity should not disappear altogether,
directed the forester to renew the hawthorn outline of the
<i>Great Michael</i>. The trees were procured for the purpose, but
the tenant of the farm on which it was situated objected that
it would take up too much room in his field, so that the project
was abandoned. It seems a thousand pities that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
cannot, even now, be done to perpetuate this relic of the
famous Scots man-of-war, which, year by year, is being rendered
more and more indistinguishable by the plough. The
field in which traces of the hollow may be looked for is situated
400 yards from the old parish chapel, which was restored
a good many years ago and used as a burial vault.</p>

<p>The <i>Great Michael</i> did not long remain a Scots ship. The
fleet of Scotland went to France in 1513, and in the following
year she was bought by Louis XII for 40,000 francs, to replace
the <i>Cordelière</i>, which, as you will remember, was blown
up with the <i>Regent</i>. This brings us back to the <i>Henri Grace
à Dieu</i>, which was built to replace the latter ship. But before
we turn our attention to her we cannot but note the difference
between the alleged cost of the <i>Great Michael</i> and that for
which she was sold. The bargain does not seem worthy of
the Scots reputation for "canniness". But we must bear in
mind that a "pound Scots" was not at all the same thing
as an English pound at that date. Ever since 1355 its value
had been falling, till by 1603 it was only worth twenty pence
instead of twenty shillings. It was, in fact, at the time of the
sale, the kind of "silver pound" that the "chieftain to the
Highlands bound" paid or promised the boatman if he would
row Lord Ullin's daughter and himself "o'er the ferry". But
even if we put it at about a tenth of a pound sterling in 1513,
the bargain seems a poor one. Probably it was more of a
political deal than anything else, comparable to the German
sale of the <i>Goeben</i> to Turkey.</p>

<p>The <i>Henri Grace à Dieu</i>&mdash;I think we may as well call her
the <i>Henri</i> for short, and save time and paper&mdash;is a ship about
which we have the most extended information in some respects&mdash;those
dealing with her decoration and equipment, for
instance; but we are left entirely in the dark as to her size
and measurements. The only dimensions I have been able
to find are those indicated on a plan which, on very insufficient
grounds, is claimed to be a copy of the official one on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which she was built, and which is stated to be&mdash;or at any
rate to have been within the last century&mdash;at Plymouth dockyard.
So far this original has not been traced, and I may
remark that anyone who knows anything about the Navy
would not dream of referring to the dockyard in the western
port except as "Devonport Dockyard". However, I give the
dimensions for what they may be worth&mdash;not much, I think:</p>

<div class='center'>Length, 145 feet; beam, 35 feet 9 inches; tonnage, 839.</div>

<p>Now if this, by any chance, is anything like correct she must
have been a very much smaller ship than the <i>Great Michael</i>,
which is not very likely, since Henry VIII would naturally
have wanted "to go one better". Moreover, she is generally
credited as having been of at least a thousand tons displacement,
and carried a battery little, if any, inferior in weight
and numbers to that of the <i>Michael</i>.</p>

<p>She was heavily equipped with ordnance, very little of
which is apparent in her pictures. According to her inventories
she carried something like 185 guns of all sorts and
sizes, but many of these must have been kept on shore as
reserve stores. She is generally credited with carrying 14
heavy guns on the lower and 12 on the main deck, and 46
light cannon on her upper works. Some of the large and
all the smaller ones were breech-loaders, and as most were
provided with at least two "chambers" or breech-pieces, which
contained the powder-charge and could be quickly substituted
one for the other, we may almost call them "quick-firers".
She was gorgeously decorated in the first place, and poop,
waist, forecastle, and tops were hung with shields showing
alternately the St. George's Cross, the Golden Fleur-de-Lis
on a blue ground, and the Tudor Rose on a green and
white ground. Her sails were woven with a decorative design
in gold damask, and she carried a lion figure-head, but
the lion was badly executed and a very tame one. Like all
Tudor ships she flew a profusion of flags, standards, and immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
streamers bearing the St. George's Cross, the fly or long-pointed
end being half green and half white. These were
the Tudor livery colours. The plain red-cross flag or "Jack"
was well in evidence and generally carried on the fore masthead
as well as among the smaller flags placed on poles at
equal distances along the bulwarks. The royal standard
was also carried, but not in every ship, and sometimes it
appears "impaled" with the national red-cross flag&mdash;that
is to say, the two were placed side by side on the same flag.</p>

<p>The national status of the Royal Navy was becoming
recognized. Before this time, though the English "Jack"
generally found a place somewhere on board an English ship,
the banners and pennons of the nobles and knights on board
were most in evidence. Now we see nothing but royal and
national emblems. In the war with France in 1455 the ships
of the squadron forming the "van" or leading portion of the
fleet carried the St. George's Cross at the fore, those of the
centre at the main, and the rear squadron at the mizzen.</p>

<p>In describing the <i>Henri</i> we have practically described all
the "great shippes" of her class, of which there were a considerable
number, though none were quite so large, or probably
quite so elaborately decorated. Of course she was what we
may call "a show ship", like the <i>Royal James</i> and <i>Sovereign
of the Seas</i> of a later date.</p>

<p>But by 1546, if we may accept Anthony Anthony's <i>Roll</i>
as correct, "timber colour" with scarlet masts and spars was
uniform for all classes of ships.</p>

<p>But it is time we turned our attention to the men who
manned them. The changes in this respect were quite as
important as those we have noted in the ships themselves.
To begin with, the nobles and gentry of the kingdom were
beginning to wake up to the fact that war afloat offered
them at least equal opportunities of distinction to those they
had hitherto looked for in land warfare. Besides, they had
now little or no chance of that at home, and there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
longer any land frontier over in France across which they
could ride and raid and harry and fight as their fathers
and grandfathers had so often done. Naval strategy was
still confined to cross raiding, but ships were now better
fighting-machines and were not merely used as platforms
for hand-to-hand fighting and as transports; so that men
of the class which had hitherto looked down on ships and
sailors began to turn their eyes towards the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">Ships of the Time of Henry VIII<br />

(<i>From a Drawing of 1545</i>)<br />

<p>Looking at the lofty hulls, the immense mainsails, and the nearness of the ports to the
water-line, we can easily understand how a want of care wrecked the <i>Mary Rose</i>. The ship
in the background on the right is apparently trying to reduce sail, and has had to lower her
main-yard. Her mainsail is almost in the water, to the apparent danger of the ship.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This does not mean that they became seamen. No, they
still remained and considered themselves soldiers, and did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
trouble to learn any seamanship. That was still the special
job of the master or skipper. But they recognized that the
command of a fighting-ship was worth having. I may
instance the Carew family.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At least three of them were
serving in command of ships in the battle at Spithead in
1545. Sir George Carew lost his life when his ship, the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, went down; his brother, Peter Carew, who had
been a year or two before in command of a company of
infantry in the English army in France, commanded a Venetian
ship&mdash;probably hired&mdash;the <i>Francisco Bardado;</i> while
their uncle, Sir Gawen Carew, commanded a third. As for
the men, the seamen, thanks to more seaworthy vessels, had
probably improved in their seamanship, while the navy
was formed into a regularly-organized force consisting of
"mariners, soldiers"&mdash;or, as we should call them now, marines&mdash;"and
gunners". Every ship had her proper complement of
each. Thus the <i>Henri Grace à Dieu</i> carried 260 seamen, 400
soldiers, and 40 gunners; the <i>Mary Rose</i> 180 seamen, 200 soldiers,
and 20 gunners; the <i>Peter Pomgranate</i> 130 seamen,
150 soldiers, and 20 gunners; and so forth, according to size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption">A SEA FIGHT IN TUDOR TIMES<br />

<cite>Facsimile woodcut from &quot;Holinshed's Chronicles&quot;</cite><br />

<p>Which particular battle this picture is supposed to represent cannot be stated, since old Holinshed uses it over and over again for almost every
naval engagement to which he makes reference right back as far as the Conquest. That cannon were not then in existence does not appear
to trouble him at all. But we may take it as fairly representative of an action at sea in the times in which the historian lived and wrote.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Though there are indications of a somewhat similar arrangement
in earlier times, it would appear that the seamen
were either paid by the king or hired with their ship, while
the soldiers were paid by some noble or even bishop who had
supplied them as a feudal obligation.</p>

<p>The pay does not seem to have been quite so liberal as
in former times, but it was not bad if we allow for the difference
in its value compared with that of to-day. In the <i>Gabriel
Royal</i>, for instance, Sir William Trevellian, the captain&mdash;a
soldier&mdash;got 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a day. The master and the rest of her
company, officers, seamen, and soldiers, got 5<i>s.</i> a month (of
twenty-eight days), but the master and other officers got in
addition what were called "dead shares", in number from six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to one-half. This means that the master got six men's pay
besides his own&mdash;altogether 35<i>s.</i>&mdash;a month, and so on in proportion.
The gunners got extra pay, called "rewards"&mdash;we
might call it "efficiency pay"&mdash;varying from 5<i>s.</i> a month for
the master gunner to 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for the private gunners.</p>

<p>The provision allowance was respectable&mdash;England was
renowned for good feeding at this period. Sundays, Tuesdays,
and Thursdays each man had ½ pound of beef and ¼ pound of
bacon for his dinner, and the same for supper. On Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Saturdays they had to be content with two
herrings and 1/8 pound of cheese for each of these meals,
while on Fridays or "ffishe days beynge ffastinge dayes"
they had to go without supper, but for dinner had either
half a cod or half a stock fish and a pound of butter between
four men, or, if they preferred it, could divide ten herrings
and a pound of cheese between them. As for bread, every
man got either a pound of bread or biscuit daily, while instead
of the "grog" or "optional cocoa" of to-day, he got a
liberal allowance either of beer or "beverage" made of two
parts water to one of "sack".</p>

<p>As for the clothing of the Royal Navy, we have very
little information so far as the Tudor period is concerned.
That there was some attempt at uniformity may be gathered
from the constant references to the provision of coats or
jackets of green and white cloth. Some were satin or damask
of the same colouring, presumably for officers. But what these
garments were like we do not know. In Anthony Anthony's
drawing of the <i>Galley Subtle</i> the master of the ship appears
in the old "jack" with the red cross, while the rowers are apparently
clad in pink. This may be intended to represent
their bare flesh, for they might be stripped to the waist for
rowing, but it is more probable that it was originally red
and that the colour has faded. It is said that the rowers of
Henry VIII's royal barge wore this colour, and it seems
quite possible that the <i>Galley Subtle</i>, the only one of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
class and a profusely-decorated vessel, <em>was</em> regarded as the
royal barge.</p>

<p>We know, too, from the costume of the Yeomen of the
Guard, or "Beefeaters", that red was making its appearance
as a military colour, for their uniform is that of Henry VIII's
body-guard. The standard under which Henry VII secured
the crown at the battle of Bosworth Field was a red dragon
on a white and green field, and was supposed to represent
that of Cadwallader, the last of the British kings, from whom
the victor claimed descent. The descent, I dare say, was
genuine enough, but Cadwallader must have died before the
invention of heraldry. But Wales has always been associated
with a dragon of this kind, which has from time immemorial
been a world-wide emblem of sovereignty. Henry seems to
have adopted the colour of the dragon as the royal livery
colour&mdash;as it remains to-day&mdash;but at the same time retained
the white and green for the navy. Much in the same way
"blue" is accepted as a royal colour, and as such is worn as
the facings of royal regiments and as the uniform of the
Royal Navy and Royal Artillery.</p>

<p>But it seems probable that blue&mdash;very possibly from dye
of that colour being easily procurable; the Ancient Britons,
we may remember, decorated themselves with blue woad&mdash;had
been for centuries a very usual colour for seamen to
wear; and when, in 1553, Sir Hugh Willoughby's North Sea
expedition was fitted out all his crews were provided with
"parade suits" of "Wachett or Skie-coloured cloth". Watchett
was a place in Somersetshire where this special material was
made. But these, perhaps, were not men actually belonging
to the Royal Navy. As for the soldiers or marines, we may
suppose that they wore the white "jack" with the red cross,
which was so universal at this time that "whitecoat" was
used for "soldier" just as "redcoat" was at a later date.
The "gunners" wore the white and green and may have been
regarded as "seamen gunners".</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

vessel, with, of course, gradual improvements, remained the
principal fighting-unit, not only in our own, but in all other
navies right up to the time of the introduction of steam power,
and indeed we may almost say later; as, though provided with
engines of no very great horse power, the sails, rigging, and
hulls of our line-of-battle ships at the time of the introduction
of the ironclad were practically the same as those of the ships
which fought at Trafalgar. We are, in fact, entering on the

I do not therefore propose to conduct my readers through
the glorious, though, if I may be allowed to say it, somewhat
hackneyed stories of the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Drake's
exploits on the Spanish Main, and the series of wars with the
Dutch, in which we met the toughest opponents we have ever
fought with for the supremacy of the seas. Neither do I
intend recounting for the hundredth time the magnificent
record of the Royal Navy in its almost continuous campaign
against those of the French kings, the French Republic, and
the Emperor Napoleon, which, beginning early in the eighteenth
century, was only finally terminated by the downfall
of the great Corsican general at Waterloo. As far as all these
are concerned I have only to say: "Now the rest of the acts
of the Royal Navy, and all that it did, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of James the Naval Historian", and
of many other historians for that matter, good, bad, and indifferent.
No, so far I have endeavoured to keep a little off
the beaten track of naval history as generally presented in
books of this class, and until we arrive at our navy of to-day
I propose to keep this principle in view; and it is in accordance
with this that, before finally quitting the Tudor period,
I propose to make a brief reference to our experiences with
the Hanseatic League.</p>

<div class="caption">DESTROYING A STRAGGLER FROM THE ARMADA<br />

<cite>From the painting by C. M. Padday</cite><br />

<p>The first Spanish ships to meet their fate were the stragglers from the main body of the Armada. Above is shown one such vessel being engaged
by an English captain. The great Spanish galleon is quite at the mercy of the smaller but handier vessel, which has got the wind of her enemy,
and is pouring a destructive fire into her prow.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The adverse influence of this great confederation of German
cities upon our country for two or three centuries has never
been sufficiently emphasized in our histories. Possibly the
earlier historians who were contemporary with the Hanseatics
were "got at" by their representatives, who swarmed in this
country and had an organized system of bribery, with a regulated
scale of bribes for all sorts of people, from the Lord
Mayor of London downwards. They seem to have been about
the only people in the later Middle Ages with ready cash in
the north of Europe, and they were glad to lend the Kings of
England money to carry on their interminable wars with
France in return for various concessions, which generally hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
British trade pretty hard. They knew how to get good
security for their loans, and in Edward III's time they actually
had the British crown in pawn at Cologne! One proof of
their tremendous financial influence in this country remains
to this day in the word "sterling". We still say "one pound
sterling", "sterling gold", &amp;c. Now "sterling" is nothing but
a corrupted form of "easterling"&mdash;a man from the eastward,
as these Hanse traders used to be called&mdash;when they were not
referred to as "Prussians".</p>

<p>At the Conquest, and for long afterwards, we were a nation
of agriculturists, soldiers, fishermen, and sailors. Our only
regular trade was in wool, therefore known as the "staple"
industry&mdash;generally "the staple" for short. It was the desire
to get their greedy fingers into this our only "pie" that first
brought the Hanse traders into this country in force some
time in the thirteenth century, though we had not been free
from them since the days of Ethelred. They were allowed to
make their head-quarters in the Steelyard in London (where
Cannon Street Station now stands), to import merchandise on
paying a nominal duty of 1 per cent, to be licensed victuallers,
keeping inns, hotels, and wine shops, to have special courts of
jurisdiction of their own, which put them above English law,
and actually to hold one of the gates of the city. Have we
not seen this financial, business, trading, and inn-keeping undermining
of British interests in our own day by the modern
easterlings?</p>

<p>Later historians preferred rather to dilate on our victories
than to refer to our encounters at sea with the Hanseatics,
in which we did not always show to advantage. For these
traders, like their modern representatives, were good pirates
on occasion, had a considerable number of fighting-ships at
their command, and, according to some authorities, had complete
control of the northern seas. Nor was there any reciprocity
about their trading arrangements. They made a rule
that only their own ships were to carry the goods they dealt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in, and sank any English ship that attempted to break it. At
the same time they would not allow our ships into the Baltic
to interfere with their trade with Russia and Scandinavia, and
now and again in return for some real or pretended grievance
attacked our seaboard and hung the crews of our coasters
to their own masts. All the time they were endeavouring to
strangle our trade from their London head-quarters. Like an
American "Trust", they were generally able to ruin individuals
or smaller companies which endeavoured to compete with them.</p>

<span class="caption">LORD HOWARD ATTACKING A SHIP OF THE SPANISH ARMADA<br />

In this fruitless attempt to invade our shores ten thousand Spaniards gave up their lives. England lost but one ship and about a hundred men.</span>
</div>

<p>Naturally the "Prussians" were not loved in this country,
and it is said that Wat Tyler's insurrection was to a great
extent directed against these interlopers, the insurgents killing
as many of them as they could get hold of. But their influence
with the Government always saved them till the days of the
Tudors, when, in spite of all obstacles, our merchants began to
make headway. Edward VI imposed heavy duties and restrictions
on them, and established an alliance and a trading connection
with Russia by sending a mission to Moscow by way
of Archangel. The marriage of Queen Mary with Philip of
Spain gave the Hanse merchants their chance, since the Prince
Consort's father&mdash;Charles V&mdash;was Emperor of Germany. The
privileges which had been taken away from the "Prussians"
by her brother were restored; but they were not to hold them
long. Queen Elizabeth had an eye to business; she saw how
the Germans were hampering the development of our trade,
and reimposed Edward VI's duty of 20 per cent on the Hanse
merchants of the Steelyard. But she found that she still had
to buy gunpowder and other munitions of war from them,
because she could not get them elsewhere, and she did not like
them the better for that. Neither did they like the reimposed
duties, and they were only too glad to assist the Spanish
Armada by sending a fleet laden with provisions and munitions
to the Tagus. Drake and the navy countered by seizing
the whole of these ships.</p>

<p>The Hanseatics, who had already before this laboured "to
render the English merchants obnoxious to the other trading
nations by various calumnies", retaliated by turning every
Englishman out of Germany. This did not affect us very
much, as, though there were a comparatively small number of
the "merchants of the staple" and the "merchant adventurers"
settled in that country, their trade and interests were not
comparable with that of the merchants of the Steelyard in
England. But the Hanseatics got a "knock out" blow in
return from "good Queen Bess", who turned the whole collection
of German merchants out of England, "lock, stock, and
barrel", and so freed the country of a menace which, while not
so obvious, was probably more insidiously dangerous than the
Spanish Armada. Then followed the break-up of Germany in
the Thirty Years' War, and British trade came by its own. It
does seem a pity that "once bit" we were not "twice shy".
Our historians are considerably to blame; but, in any case, we
ought not to have so entirely forgotten what a menace German
trade and German immigration might be to this country.</p>

<p>"What has all this to do with the navy?" may perhaps be
asked. Possibly not much at first sight, but in reality a great
deal. If, during the centuries the Hanse merchants were throttling
our trade, we had maintained a formidable and national
navy instead of pursuing a hand-to-mouth policy and utilizing
our ships principally as ferry-boats to take our armies over to
France, we might have been in a better position to deal with
the Hanse League. We could have prevented interference with
our ships, forced our way into the Baltic, and extended our
trade. On the other hand, the navy was not a national navy,
but, generally speaking, a personal appanage of the reigning
monarch, who as often as not was very heavily in debt to the
"Prussians". Gold is a very powerful factor, even in naval
warfare, if judiciously applied, and not misapplied, as when
some of our feebler Saxon kings bought off the viking invaders
with "Danegelt".</p>

<p>I am tempted, before leaving the Hansa, to relate a story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a><br /><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of one of their smaller naval operations, which, I must premise,
is taken from a German source, so you can believe as much or
as little of it as you please. But it is not a bad story in its
way. Our King Edward IV had fallen out with the King
of Denmark, who, in retaliation for a real or alleged piratical
attack made by the traders of Lynn upon his dominions in
Iceland, set to work to capture our merchantmen, using
apparently the ships of his allies, the Hanse League, for the
purpose. King Edward, in his turn, at once closed the Steelyard,
and, according to this account, strangled many of its
merchants, and demanded £20,000 compensation for his captured
ships. At this time there were a couple of rather big
Hanse ships lying in a Dutch harbour, the <i>Mariendrache</i> and
the <i>Anholt</i>. Hearing of the English preparations for war,
Paul Beneke, who was in command, stood over to Deal under
French colours to intercept the Lord Mayor of London, who
was expected to land there on his way back from Paris in
<i>La Cygne</i> of Dieppe. How he discovered this we are not
told.</p>

<p>By the use of French colours Paul Beneke succeeded
in kidnapping the Mayor of Deal and various other notabilities,
who thought they were going on board <i>La Cygne</i>
to welcome the Lord Mayor. The two Hanseatic ships then
put to sea, intercepted the real French ship and her consort
<i>La Madeline of Cannes</i>, took out their distinguished passenger
and whatever goods they had on board, and made for the
Dutch harbour they had started from. The omniscient
Beneke knew that it was being blockaded by thirteen small
English ships and one much more powerful than either of his,
the <i>St. John</i>, possibly the <i>John Evangelist of Dartmouth</i>.
However, thanks to a fog, he got through the blockade
undiscovered. Late at night he, with one other companion,
pulled out to sea in a fishing-boat, and, under the pretence
of being Dutch fishermen, went alongside the big <i>St. John</i>
and asked leave to make fast astern while they boiled their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
"beer soup" for supper. Permission was granted, and, as the
"beer soup" in question was in reality molten lead, they had
not much difficulty, under cover of the lofty and overhanging
stern, in pouring it into the iron joints of the rudder, so that
it became immovable. Then, "after supper", having thanked
the obliging officer of the watch, Beneke and his confederate
made their way back to their own ship. The following
morning the two Germans stood out of harbour and attacked
the English fleet, and, as none of its ships were big enough
to put up any fight against them, with the exception of the
<i>St. John</i>, and she was not under control, thanks to Beneke's
strategem, they are said to have won a "glorious victory".
Veracious or not, this tale has one realistic touch about it in
the evident desire to win by underhand means rather than
by fair fighting. But we seem to have been blown a bit out
of our course, and must get back to our point of departure.</p>

<p>Although Henry VIII is inseparably connected with the
<i>Henri Grace à Dieu</i>, this famous ship was by no means the
only improved type of fighting-ship which dates from his
reign. There were, besides the great ships, such as the <i>Henri</i>,
the <i>Jesus of Lubeck</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and others, a class known as galleasses,
without a raised poop and forecastle, with a single tier of
heavy guns, and a protruding spur or "beak" forward. They
had fully-rigged main- and foremasts, a mizen and a bonaventure
mizen&mdash;these last two masts very small and carrying
a single lateen sail apiece&mdash;and a long bowsprit. There is
little doubt that these were an adaptation of the Mediterranean
galleys modified to suit Northern seas. Ships were
longer-lived in those days than at present, and though many
of those in Elizabeth's navy had originally belonged to that
of her father, in the newer vessels their constructors endeavoured
to combine the best qualities of both the great
ships and the galleasses. The ships of this improved type
were known as "galleons", a word that is generally, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
erroneously, taken to refer only to Spanish ships. The battleships
of both nations were galleons at this period, but they
differed considerably in their general lines and in their
armament.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the Spanish ships were higher out
of the water and carried lighter cannon than our own. An
Elizabethan battleship, then, was rather longer than earlier
great ships, and, though she still had a comparatively high
stern, it was not to be compared in this respect with that
of the <i>Henri</i>. The "fore castle" had come down to a very
low affair, the bows finishing with a "beak-head" adopted
from the galleasse, but with the spur at its extremity replaced
by a figurehead&mdash;generally a lion, dragon, or unicorn. The
general uniformity in colouring which marked the earlier
Tudor men-of-war had been replaced by a "go as you please"
system, under which one ship had her upper works painted
red, another white and green, a third black and white, while
a fourth might retain the old regulation timber colour.
Considerable sums were expended in carving, gilding, and
decoration in colour, not only at the bow and stern, but along
the exterior of the bulwarks. As regards the armament
carried afloat, at this and later times, particulars will be given
in a future chapter.</p>

<p>An old writer of the period takes satisfaction in pointing
out the superiority of the English over foreign ships. "As
for those of the Portuguese," he says, "they are the veriest
drones on the sea, the rather because their seeling<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was
dammed up with a certain kind of mortar to dead the shot."
"The French," he goes on to say, "however dextrous in land
battles, are left-handed in sea-fights, whose best ships are of
Dutch building. The Dutch build their ships so floaty and
buoyant, they have little hold in the water in comparison to
ours, which keep the better wind and so out-sail them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Spanish pride hath infected their ships with loftiness, which
makes them but the fairer marks to our shot. Besides the
wind hath so much power of them in bad weather, that it
drives them two leagues for one of ours to leeward&mdash;which
is very dangerous upon a lee-shore." He states further that
the "Turkish frigots", especially those built at Algiers, are
much the best foreign ships; being "built much nearer the
English mode", and they "may hereafter prove mischievous
to us, if not seasonably prevented". The writer was perfectly
correct in his last remark, as will be seen in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>Here are a few extracts from Sir Walter Raleigh's directions
for "clearing for action". The captain is to appoint "sufficient
company to assist the gunners", by which it would appear
that the number of guns carried had increased faster than the
complement of "gonnars" allotted to a man-of-war. If necessary,
"the cabins between the decks shall be taken down, all beds
and sacks employed for bulwarks". The "musketiers"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> were
to be distributed between the "fore-castell", the "mast", and
the "poope". The gunners were ordered not to fire except
at point-blank range, that is to say, until pretty close alongside
the enemy. An officer was to be specially detailed to see
that there was no loose powder carried between decks nor
near any lighted gun-matches. About the decks were to be
distributed "divers hogsheads" sawn in half and filled with
water. No one was to board the enemy's ship without orders;
special men were told off to each sail; while the carpenter and
his crew were to attend with plugs and sheets of lead, some
in the hold, others on the lower deck, in readiness to plug up
shot holes between wind and water.</p>

<p>In the early Stuart period there were no very great changes
in the construction and appearance of our men-of-war, but
they gradually&mdash;if we may judge from their pictures&mdash;seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to have acquired a more "ship-shape" look, and give one the
idea of greater roominess. The bonaventure mizen-mast disappears,
so that there are only three masts instead of four, and
the mizen is provided with a topsail in addition to its lateen. At
the end of the bowsprit, too, appears a little top and top-mast,
while a square sail is spread on a yard slung below it. This
sail has a large round hole in each lower corner, to let the water
run out when it is plunged under water as the ship pitches.
The <i>Prince Royal</i> was the show ship of those days, and no
less than £441 was spent on her carved decorations, and £868
on gilding them. She was our first three-decker, if we include
the upper deck, and had a displacement of 1200 tons.</p>

<div class="caption">THE <i>ROYAL GEORGE</i> ENGAGING THE <i>SOLEIL ROYAL</i> IN QUIBERON BAY, 1759<br />

<p>Admiral Hawke in this engagement gained a decisive victory. The <i>Royal George</i> was the first of an improved type of ship. Her end was
a tragic one, for she capsized and sank at Spithead, taking 900 people with her.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1637 was launched the much more famous <i>Sovereign of
the Seas</i>. She was a very handsome vessel, longer and lower
in the water than the <i>Prince Royal</i>, and 483 tons bigger. In
the <cite>Travels of Cosmo III</cite>, Duke of Tuscany, through England,
about thirty years after she was launched, the following
account is given of her: "This monstrous vessel was built in
the year 1637 by King Charles I at incredible expense; for,
besides the vast size of the ship, which is an hundred and twenty
paces in length, it has cabins roofed with carved work, richly
ornamented with gold, and the outside of the stern is decorated
in a similar manner. The height of the stern is quite extraordinary,
and it is hung with seven magnificent lanthorns, the
principal one, which is more elevated than the rest, being
capable of containing six people. The ship carries 106 pieces
of brass cannon, and requires a thousand men for its equipment.
His Highness went to the highest part of the stern,
and having walked over the whole length from stern to prow
as well above as below, stepped into the handsomest cabin in
the stern, where there were still evident marks of the sides
having been repaired from the effect of cannon-balls, which
sufficiently indicated that it had been more than once in
action." The <i>Sovereign</i> was coloured outside black and gold,
and had an elaborate figure-head representing King Edgar on
horseback trampling on seven kings. During the Commonwealth
and Restoration there were continuous improvements
in ship design, due, no doubt, in some measure, to the constant
fighting with the Dutch. Our naval constructors naturally
wanted to build better ships; they had the Dutch prizes to
study, and our sea officers saw a good deal of the French men-of-war,
which during the latter part of the war assisted them
against the Dutch. The <i>Royal Charles</i> of 1673 may be taken
as the link between the <i>Sovereign</i> and the eighteenth-century
ships of our navy. She was a handsome ship, rather smaller
than the <i>Sovereign</i>, with a rounded stern at the water-line,
instead of its being put in flat like that of an ordinary boat.
This not only made ships built in this way, as they always
were after this time, stronger, but gave them more graceful
lines, as well as better ones for sailing.</p>

<p>The French about this time began to turn out ships on
much better lines than our own, and throughout the eighteenth
century and part of the nineteenth our French prizes were
our best-looking and best-sailing ships. However, a writer at
the very end of the seventeenth century makes the following
comparison between the fighting capacity of the French and
British ships of the period: "Our guns, being for the most part
shorter," he says, "are made to carry more shot than a French
gun of like weight, therefore the French guns reach further,
and ours make a bigger hole. By this the French has the
advantage to fight at a distance, and we yard-arm to yard-arm.
The like advantage have we over them in shipping; although
they are broader and carry a better sail, our sides are thicker
and better able to receive their shot; by this they are more
subject to be sunk by our gun-shot than we." At the beginning
of the eighteenth century the exterior of the bulwarks
of the upper deck, poop, and forecastle was generally painted
blue, though occasionally red. On this broad band, carved
devices, generally representing trophies of colours, arms, and
guns, were placed between the ports, which on the upper deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a><br /><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were round. Outboard a carved wreath encircled them, which,
with the numerous other ornamental carvings at bow and
stern, was profusely gilded. Below this broad blue band the
sides of the ship were of a yellow tinge, and were finished off,
just above the water-line, with a single or double black wale.</p>

THE <i>VICTORY</i> IN GALA DRESS<br />

<p>Nelson's famous flagship, dressed with flags in honour of the visit of the French President
to Portsmouth.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hull below this was painted white. The ship's sides inboard
were usually coloured red, in order, the story goes, that
the crew should not be affected by the sight of blood splashes
in action. The gun-carriages were often the same colour. The
beak-head had disappeared, and the stem curved up at a somewhat
abrupt angle, finishing off with a big figure-head, as
often as not a lion. As the century went on it was found that
not only were the French building better ships than our own,
but the Spaniards also. Our ships might possibly have had
thicker sides, as claimed by the old writer already quoted, but
towards the middle of the century there were great complaints
of their structural weakness, and in 1746 the first of an improved
and stronger type was taken in hand. This was the
<i>Royal George</i>, memorable especially from her tragic end at
Spithead, where she capsized and went down, taking 900 men,
women, and children with her. In 1765 Nelson's <i>Victory</i>&mdash;perhaps
the most famous ship in history&mdash;was built. Thenceforward
our battleships were classified by the number of guns
they carried. Thus the <i>Victory</i> and sister ships carried 100
guns. Then came 90-gun ships, 80-gun ships, "74's", "64's",
and 50-gun ships.</p>

<p>As time went on there was naturally a slight increase in
size in the newer ships, but they were not altered in type.
Thus the <i>Hibernia</i> of 1795 was of 2508 tons displacement, as
against the 1921 tons of the <i>Victory</i>, and mounted ten more
guns. Perhaps the finest sailing three-decker ever built was
the <i>Queen</i>, begun in 1833 and launched in 1839. This ship
had a displacement of 4476 tons, yet a picture of her would
almost pass muster for the <i>Victory</i>. The <i>Duke of Wellington</i>
was built as a sailing-ship, but fitted with engines before her
launch in 1852, and was very much the same to look at, except
that her stern was more rounded and had two or three projecting
balconies or "stern-walks". The <i>Duke</i> brings us to the
end of the epoch of wooden line-of-battle ships. Iron ships
protected with armour took their place, but these will be dealt
with in another chapter.</p>

<p>The external colouring of our men-of-war remained much
the same up to the battle of Trafalgar, though the carving and
gilding grew gradually less. At the Nile in 1797 there were
ships of all sorts of colouring. Thus the <i>Audacious</i> had plain
yellow sides, the <i>Zealous</i> red sides with yellow stripes. Most,
however, were yellow, with different numbers of narrow black
stripes. This yellow and black developed into what was known
as "Nelson Mode"&mdash;yellow bands on the lines of the gun-ports,
with black bands between. It is this style with which
we are most familiar, on account of the many paintings and
engravings of men-of-war in action at that and more recent
periods; for, except that later on the yellow was changed to
white, the fashion lasted till the advent of the ironclads.</p>

<p>Having glanced in this cursory manner at the ships which
flew the "meteor flag" between the times of our two greatest
queens, Elizabeth and Victoria, it will be well to give some
account, however brief, of the costume of the men who manned
them.</p>

<p>We have little or no personal information about the seamen
of the Elizabethan navy, but we know from their doughty
deeds that they were good men and true, and we also know
that they, like their predecessors, were pretty well paid and
provisioned. Uniform clothing they probably had not,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but
in the reign of James I there is a description of a masque in
which appeared men dressed as "skippers", in red caps, short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cassocks, wide canvas breeches striped with red, and red
stockings. The six "principal masters of the navy" were
provided annually with coats of red cloth, "guarded", or faced,
with velvet of the same colour, and "embroidered with ships,
roses, crowns, and other devices". But, though this fine apparel
was provided for the favoured few, the seamen began at this
time to be neglected, poorly paid, badly fed, and ill-treated&mdash;thanks
probably to having such greedy officials and incapable
officers as the Duke of Buckingham and other courtiers at the
head of the navy. The Venetian ambassador to James I reports
the great falling off of the British navy as compared to
that of Henry VII and VIII.</p>

<p>The constantly smouldering match of the former rendered it a very dangerous
weapon in the neighbourhood of cannon; the &quot;snaphaunce&quot;, or &quot;fusil&quot;, was fitted
with a &quot;fire-lock&quot;, in which a spark was struck from a flint.</p></div>
</div>
<p>"Now", he writes, "it only numbers thirty-seven ships,
many of them old and rotten and barely fit for service."
Never was it in a worse state, and good men were naturally
harder and harder to get. Charles I was anxious to restore
the navy to its former glory and efficiency, but his persistency
in demanding "ship-money" from his subjects led
eventually to the Civil War, which resulted in his downfall.
The Commonwealth, however, did what he had been ambitious
of doing himself: it spent large sums on the navy, and ships
and men were once more in good case. With the Restoration
set in rottenness and corruption. Even Charles II, though
he was too careless or too incapable to remedy matters,
recognized the state of affairs. "If ever", said he, at a meeting
of the Council, "you intend to man the fleet without being
cheated by the captains and pursers, you may go to bed and
resolve never to have it manned." His brother James was
more keenly interested in the navy, in which he had himself
served against the Dutch, and no doubt improved matters
in various respects, but the lot of a seaman was still a hard
one. It may have been at his suggestion, when Duke of
York, that the maritime regiment, of which he was the first
commander, was raised, possibly with some idea of its being
the nucleus of a permanent establishment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>These early marines, who were not infrequently referred
to as "mariners", wore coats of the duke's favourite yellow
with red breeches and stockings, and carried the flag of
St. George, with the addition of the golden rays of the sun
issuing from each corner of the cross&mdash;possibly "the glorious
sun of York", as Shakespeare has it. It is interesting to note
that they were the first fusiliers, though not in name. For
probably to prevent danger from lighted matches on board
a ship in action, they were armed with "snaphaunce muskets"
or fusils&mdash;that is to say, flintlocks instead of the matchlocks
usually carried by the infantry of the period. The 7th
Fusiliers, who were raised as an artillery escort a few years
later, were armed in the same way for a similar reason; and
it is curious that, though never called fusiliers, the marines
have almost always followed fusilier customs, as to uniform,
in never having any officers of the rank of ensign,

the devil is referred to as having appeared to someone in
Newcastle "in seaman's clothing with a blew cape". And
again, in the description of the supporters of the coat-of-arms
granted to the Earl of Torrington, who died 1689, we read
that they are "Two sailors proper, habited with jackets and
caps on their heads <em>azure</em>, with white trowsers striped
<i>gules</i>," i.e. red. The following is a list of seamen's clothing
or "slops" and prices, as authorized by James, Duke of York,

</div>

<p>A "Monmouth cap" is said to have been worn by both seamen
and soldiers, and to have resembled a "tam-o'-shanter",
but there appears to be some doubt about it. It seems
possible that it may equally well have been what we now call
a "fisherman's cap", or a cap like that worn by the bands of
the Household Cavalry, but with the peak turned perpendicularly
upwards. We sometimes see pictures of boats'
crews in such caps at about this period.</p>

<p>In 1706 blue seems to have been superseded by grey,
seamen being directed to wear "grey jackets and red trousers,
brass and tin buttons, blue and white check shirts and drawers,
grey woollen stockings, gloves(!), leather caps faced with red
cotton;" also "striped ticken waistcoats and breeches". Naval
officers apparently wore what they pleased, though there are
indications that red was the favourite colour right up to 1748,
when a blue uniform with white facings and gold lace was
ordered by the King. But it is said that naval officers did
not take kindly to it at first, and in some ships tried to evade
the order by having but one or two uniform coats on board,
which were only worn by officers when sent away on duty
where questions might be asked.</p>

<p>Red was now the recognized military colour, and, as
mentioned elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> naval officers took a long time to forget
the old military status of the commanders of the royal ships.
Blue with white linings or facings is said to have been the
uniform of two regiments of marines&mdash;who were "to be all
fuzileers without pikes"&mdash;raised in 1690; but this had no
connection with King George's selection, which is stated to
have been due to his having seen the Duchess of Bedford,
wife of the First Lord of the Admiralty, riding in the park
in a habit of blue faced with white, which prodigiously
took His Majesty's fancy. The seamen seem to have worn
grey and red up to about this time, when green and blue
baize frocks and trousers were provided for them. The
sailor of this period is described as wearing "a little low
cocked hat, a pea-jacket (a sort of cumbrous Dutch-cut
coat), a pair of petticoat trousers, not unlike a Scotch kilt,
tight stockings, with pinchbeck buckles on his shoes". The
"little cocked hat" is elsewhere described as having its flaps
tacked close down to the crown, which made it look like
"a triangular apple pasty". This hat was gradually replaced
by a tarpaulin or straw hat, not a bit like that worn at the
present day, but more nearly resembling a low inverted flowerpot
with a narrow curly brim. Short, open, blue jackets
began to be worn&mdash;"round jackets" they were called&mdash;showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the check shirt or a red or buff waistcoat. The trousers
were longer than previously, and round the hat was often
worn a bright blue ribband bearing the ship's name. Black,
or occasionally coloured, bandana handkerchiefs were loosely
knotted round the neck. In Nelson's days it was a favourite
practice of the seamen to sew strips of white canvas over
the seams of their jackets by way of ornamentation, and to
adorn them with as many buttons as possible. Pigtails were
in full fashion and of a portentous length and stiffness, leading
to the adoption of the square "sailor collar" to protect
the cloth jackets from grease. But though a regulation
uniform had been prescribed for officers there was no strict
regulation as to the seaman's dress before 1857, an exact
reversal of the previous state of things.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century captains very
often dressed their crews in "fancy rigs", but the short jacket,
trousers taut on the hips and long and loose in the legs, with
a straw or tarpaulin hat&mdash;now with a flat brim and lower
crown&mdash;remained the general costume of the British sailor
until, after the introduction of continuous service, a regulation
uniform was laid down, as mentioned above. The marines,
who had originally been under the War Office, and had worn
different facings in their different regiments, were, in 1755,
formed into the present corps under the Admiralty and
dressed in red with white facings, which were changed to
blue in 1802 on the occasion of the distinction "Royal" being
granted them, on the representations of Lord St. Vincent, as
a recognition of their services both in action and in the
suppression of various disorders in the fleet. One more
change was made in the uniform of naval officers, by William
IV, who instituted red facings. It was a temporary one only,
for in about ten years the navy was glad to be allowed to
resume the time-honoured blue and white.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;"><cite>The Sack of Baltimore</cite>, by <span class="smcap">Thomas Osborne Davis</span>.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">You</span> may read dozens of English histories, and even histories
of the British Navy, and find little or no mention of the subject
of this chapter. And yet during the sixteenth, seventeenth,
and part of the eighteenth centuries the Algerine
pirates, or "Turks" as they were generally called, were a real
menace to our trade, our fishermen, and even to the dwellers
on our coasts. The story is not at all a creditable one to us
as a nation, nor did the Navy itself gain any particular distinction
in fighting with these pests; but this was not so much
the fault of our sea-commanders and their men as of the
Government, which rarely gave them any real opportunity
of exterminating the Turkish pirates that infested even our
home waters.</div>

<p>The most discreditable part of all was that played by the
British renegades, who were, more than anyone else, responsible
for the Turkish efficiency at sea. Left to themselves,
the corsairs from Algiers, Tunis, and Salee would never have
become formidable. In mediæval times, as has already been
noted, the English had the reputation of being "good seamen,
but better pirates", and piracy (including English piracy),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
though scotched, was not killed till some time after the days
of "Good Queen Bess". Why, in the youth of Edward VI,
when the country was ruled by the Regent Somerset, the
Regent's own brother&mdash;Sir Thomas Seymour, the Lord High
Admiral of England&mdash;did not disdain to "do a bit in that
line" himself!</p>

<p>The story is this. He had been married to the Queen
Dowager. When she died, he found himself rather "hard
up". From his position he knew all about the Channel pirates;
he had dealt with lots of them, and "executed justice" on
them for their misdeeds. Now, however, he entered into a
surreptitious partnership with them, "winked the other eye"
at complaints, and pocketed half-profits. He did so well that
he tried to start a special mint of his own at Bristol. He
still pretended to the Regent and the Council to be very poor,
and eventually succeeded in getting an addition of 1500
ducats a year to his salary. He was allowed, moreover, to
draw this in a lump sum in advance. But it was not very
long before the Council began to "smell a rat". The pirates
naturally got bolder and bolder, knowing that they could
work with impunity, and Sir Thomas Seymour was asked
"why he did not look after these matters?" "Oh," said he,
"I am just sending three ships after these fellows! I'll soon
make things all right." His ships sailed, but only to become
the worst and most successful freebooters in British waters.
Their depredations and his great wealth, which, it seems, he
spent openly and extravagantly, could not long remain a secret,
and he was again summoned before the Council. He still
asserted that he was poverty-stricken, but he could no longer
get anyone to believe him, and a piratical captain who was
captured about this time admitted, under examination, that
the admiral had "gone halves" with him. "Brother or no
brother, he must be executed for this," said the Protector
Somerset&mdash;and he was.</p>

<p>When a man in Sir Thomas Seymour's exalted position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
could behave in this manner, one can hardly be surprised that
lesser "gentlemen" were not ashamed to follow in his footsteps&mdash;even
some years later.</p>

<p>The first appearance of Mohammedan pirates in Northern
waters was at a time very remote from that of which I am
now writing, but I think it is of sufficient interest to deserve
a passing reference. It was in the year 1048&mdash;just eighteen
years before the Conquest&mdash;that news came to William of
Normandy that a band of Moorish or Saracen pirates had
established themselves in a castle which they had built on an
eminence right in the middle of the Island of Guernsey, from
which they harassed and terrorized the inhabitants. A knight,
Samson d'Anville, was sent to destroy "Le Château du Grand
Sarrasin", as it was called, and he apparently succeeded in
rooting out the wasps' nest; and when in 1203 a church was
built on the site, the salvation of the islanders was commemorated
by its consecration as "Notre Dame de la Deliverance
du Castel". Catel Church still stands on this historic
spot. We hear no more of Saracen pirates in Northern
seas till the sixteenth century, unless the mysterious ships
which were driven ashore near Berwick in 1254 were in any
way connected with them. Certainly the ships of any Northern
nation would have been recognizable on our north-east
coast. The ships in question "were large handsome vessels,
but unlike anything ever before seen in this country: well
provided with naval stores and provisions, and laden with
coats of mail, shields and weapons of all kinds, sufficient
for an army".<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Their crews were arrested "as barbarians, or
spies, or even enemies", but as no one understood their language,
nothing whatever could be made of them, and so they
were eventually allowed to depart in peace. Who they were,
whence they came, and whither they went has never been
discovered. The incident remains one of the most impenetrable
of the many mysteries of the sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>The foundation of the piratical States on the north coast
of Africa, which were to be the source of untold misery to
European nations, may be traced to the final expulsion of the
Moors from Spain in 1509. Pursued by the Spaniards to
Algiers&mdash;or Argier, as it was then usually called&mdash;the Moors
called in the assistance of Arouji Barbarossa, a noted Mediterranean
corsair. He succeeded in beating off the invaders
and established himself as first Dey. Tunis, Sallee, and other
rover communities soon sprang up along the African coast,
and, beginning by retaliating on the Spaniards, the "Turks"
gradually extended their sphere of operations till they became
a terror to Christendom.</p>

<p>Christendom had itself to blame in a very great measure,
since the Christian nations could never agree long enough
between themselves to stamp out effectively these nests of
pirates. Ceasing to be content with the spoils and slaves they
could capture in the Mediterranean, they set themselves to&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Keeping in awe the Bay of Portingale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the ocean by the British Shore".<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span><br />
</div>

<p>The churchwardens' accounts of the parish of St. Helen's,
Abingdon, bear curious witness to the pitch at which Turkish
piracy had arrived by the year 1565. An entry in this year
runs as follows: "Payde for two bokes of Common Prayer
agaynst invading of the Turke 0<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>" The special prayer
was probably the one that ran thus:</p>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"O Almighty and Everlasting God, our Heavenly Father, we Thy
disobedient and rebellious children, now by Thy just judgement sore
afflicted, and in great danger to be oppressed, by Thine and our sworn
and most deadly enemies, the Turks, &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>The danger was evidently felt to be imminent. By 1576
the "Turks" of Argier had no less than 25,000 Christian captives
in their cruel clutches. Most, certainly, came from the
southern European countries, but our turn was to come, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
half a dozen years later the miscreants were boasting as much
to their English captives. We still had our own as well as
Flemish, Irish, and French piratical gentlemen in the Channel
at this time, for in 1580 the Council called the attention of
the Cinque Ports to the fact that such robbers were "daily
received and harboured by the inhabitants of the said places,
making open sale of their spoils without interruption".</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="caption">A Turkish Pirate Ship of 1579<br />

<p>Observe the sharp ram, the tower-like forecastle, and the curiously perched cabin
aft. Also the tail-like ornaments at the stern, possibly reminiscent of the sterns of the
old &quot;Dragon-ships&quot; and &quot;Long Serpents&quot;. The big and somewhat triangular openings
are probably gun-ports, but no guns are visible.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is probable that the attempts at the suppression of our
own sea-robbers drove some of them into the ranks of the
Barbary corsairs. And among them, it is shameful to relate,
were not a few men of good family. Captain John Smith, who
wrote about 1630, explains that at the accession of James I
the "Gentlemen Adventurers" and other seaman who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
long carried on a sort of licensed piracy against the Spanish
possessions and ships on the Spanish Main, found themselves,
like Othello, with their "occupation gone". James wanted
to live at peace with everybody. As an epigram of the time
put it:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When Elizabeth was England's King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That dreadful name thro' Spain did ring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How altered is the case ad sa'me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">These juggling days of good Queen Jamie".</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>So that, to quote John Smith on the Gentlemen Adventurers,
"those that were rich, rested with what they had; those that
were poor, and had nothing but from hand to mouth, turned
pirates; some because they were slighted of those for whom
they had got much wealth; some for that they could not get
their due; some that had lived bravely would not abase themselves
to poverty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now because they grew hateful to all
Christian Princes, they retired to Barbary, where altho' there
be not many good harbours, but Tunis, Algier, Sally, Marmora
and Tituane, there are many convenient roads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ward,
a poor English sailor, and Dansker, a Dutchman made first
here their marts when the Moors scarce knew how to sail
a ship. Bishop was ancient and did little hurt; but Easton
got so much as made himself a Marquess in Savoy, and Ward
lived like a Bashaw in Barbary; those were the first taught
the Moors to be men of war." He gives the names of several
other noted English pirates of the time: some were hung,
others were "mercifully pardoned" by King James. Other
villains acted as agents and contrived to give the "Turks"
wind of the sailing of any punitive expedition.</div>

<p>"For there being several Englishmen," writes Sir William
Monson, the celebrated Admiral, "who have been too long in
trading with pirates, and furnishing them with powder and
other necessaries, it is to be feared those same Englishmen
will endeavour to give the pirates intelligence, lest their being
taken, their wicked practices should be discovered." Thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to such scoundrels as these the "Turks" were able to attack
us in our own waters. By 1616 they had no less than thirty
ships north of the Mediterranean, and in that year a Salee
rover was actually captured in the River Thames. By the
year following so many British ships had been taken by the
"Turks" that the merchants of London established a fund
of £40,000&mdash;the Trinity House contributing £1068&mdash;"for the
merchants and ships of the Port of London as a fund against
the Turks". Four hundred and sixty British ships had
already fallen into their hands.</p>

<p>When in 1619 Sir John Killigrew asked permission to
erect a lighthouse on the Lizard the Trinity House refused,
on the ground "that it is not necessary or convenient to erect
a lighthouse there, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per contra</i>, inconvenient, having regard
to <em>pirates</em> and enemies whom it would conduct to a safe place
of landing". In 1620 James I was at last persuaded to send
an expedition against "Argier". The £40,000 collected in
London, and other sums subscribed, went towards its equipment.
It consisted of six men-of-war and twelve hired
merchantmen under Sir Robert Mansell; but as during the
previous sixteen years of the King's reign, "never a nail had
been knocked into any of the Royal ships", and as their captains
"were of little repute", the whole affair turned out such
a dismal failure that the Algerines were encouraged to attack
us with greater determination than ever.</p>

<p>"But too true it is," wrote Monson, "that since that time
our poor English, and especially the people of the West country,
who trade that way daily, fall into the hands of those
pirates. It is too lamentable to hear their complaints, and
too intolerable to suffer the misery that has befallen them."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>By 1625 the Turkish pirate ship was "a common object of
the seashore" in the West. There were at least a score of
them in the Channel. They captured the Island of Lundy,
and, "Hun-like", threatened to burn Ilfracombe unless a
large sum was paid as indemnity. They landed in Cornwall
one Sunday, surrounded a church while divine service was
proceeding, and carried off sixty men from the congregation
into slavery. Some months earlier it had been officially
reported that there were nearly 1400 Englishmen captive
in Salee alone, "all, or greatest part, taken within 20 or 30
miles of Dartmouth, Plymouth, or Falmouth. When the
winter takes, then the Sally men-of-war go to Flushing and
Holland, where, having supplied all wants, and the winter
past, they go to sea again. If they want men in the places
with the Dutch, they are furnished."</p>

<p>Perhaps the most celebrated coastal raid was that made
by Murad Reis upon the village of Baltimore, on the Munster
coast, on 31st June, 1631. Piloted by a traitor from Dungarvon&mdash;one
Flachet by name, who, it is consoling to learn,
expiated his crime on the scaffold&mdash;the "Turks" sailed into
the little harbour in the dead of night and descended on
the sleeping village like a "bolt from the blue". Completely
surprised, the Irishmen could oppose no resistance to the
dark-skinned demons and their blacker-hearted renegade
comrades. Those who were not fortunate enough to be slain
on their own doorsteps were herded on board the corsairs
with all the weeping women and children of the village, even
babies in arms, and carried off into a captivity worse than
death itself. The total "bag" amounted to 237 men, women,
and children. Baltimore was then a thriving fishing centre,
but it has never recovered from this raid. The south coast
of Ireland and the Bristol Channel seem to have been a
favourite hunting-ground at this period. Murad had already
been harrying the English coast before he carried out his
coup at Baltimore. The year before the "Turks" had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
six ships <em>near Bristol</em>, and had something like forty ships
operating in English waters. But the Government of King
Charles was so feeble and so incompetent that even the Sack
of Baltimore failed to rouse it to the necessary action.</p>

<p>The navy was willing enough to deal with the pirates, but
it was in a very poor way itself, its men robbed, starved, and
stinted, its ships and many of their commanders anything but
efficient. It is even stated that two of the King's ships lying
at Kinsale had word of Murad Reis's attack, but did not
attempt to intercept it. Apparently all that was done was to
set up additional alarm-beacons on the coast. Captain Richard
Plumleigh wrote from Waterford in October of the year
following, reporting an engagement he had had with "the
arch-pirate Nutt", and adds, "Nutt has 2 Turks with him and
his consort.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I never saw people in whom one disaster
had settled so deep an impression as the Turks' last descent
hath done in these Irish: every small fleet they see on the
coast puts them into arms, or at least to their heels."</p>

<p>There would appear to have been something like a permanent,
though inefficient, watch in St. George's Channel
about this time, for in 1634 Sir John Plumleigh, another
naval officer, writes from the Isle of Man, after "scouring"
those waters, "Of the Turks as yet we hear nothing, though
the general bruit runs that they intend hither this year, as
some prisoners from Algiers have written over to their friends".
So enterprising had the pirates become that not long before
this it was represented very strongly to the Mayor of Barnstaple
that "unless vigorous steps are taken for the suppression
of these marauders" there was great danger that
"they will fall upon our fishing shippes both at Newfoundland
and Virginea, for they desire both our shippes and
men".</p>

<p>The "Turks" were, in fact, insatiable. At this time it
was reported that they had 25,000 Christian slaves in Algiers
alone, besides 8000 renegades, among whom were over 1000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
women. The petitions to the Government from coastal towns,
from merchants, from the friends and relations of the unhappy
captives, were legion&mdash;but nothing practical was done. The
celebrated Robert Boyle writes of his passage from Youghal
to Bristol in 1635, that he accomplished it safely, "though the
Irish coasts were infested with Turkish galleys".</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i136.jpg" width="359" height="600" alt="painting of prisoners released" />
<div class="caption">THE RELEASE OF CHRISTIAN PRISONERS AT ALGIERS<br />

<p>The bold and aggressive Turkish pirates were for long the terror of merchantmen. So
successful were they in their raids that at one time they were reported to have 25,000
Christian slaves in Algiers alone.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two years later a squadron under Captain William Rainsborow
was actually dispatched against Salee. This port was
blockaded by four ships, which were reinforced by four more,
and after destroying every Turkish ship which attempted to
break the blockade, the squadron closed in to the city, and so
battered its fortifications that the pirates were glad to make
terms by giving up 400 English slaves. The success of Captain
Rainsborow shows what might have been done had the same
process been applied to other pirate cities on the African coast,
but, strange to say, our forefathers were content merely to
"scotch the snake", without making an end of it once and for all.</p>

<p>By 1640 the Turks were as bold and aggressive as ever.
Three Turkish men-of-war attacked the <i>Elizabeth</i> off the
Lizard and burned her, and shortly afterwards landed at
Penzance and carried off sixty men, women, and children.
The Deputy-Lieutenant of Cornwall reported that there were
about sixty Turkish pirates off the coast at this time. In
1645 it is stated that they landed again at Fowey, and made
slaves of 240 persons, including some ladies.</p>

<p>Occasionally some of our merchant-ships were able to put
up a successful defence against the "Turks".</p>

<p>There were several instances of this in the Mediterranean,
and here is a shipmaster's report of how he did the like in
the Channel in 1638: "W. Nurry, of this town and county of
Poole, Mariner and Master under God of the good ship called
the <i>Concord</i> of Poole, burthen, 80 tons, with 6 guns, 12 men,
and 2 boys, being about 6 or 7 leagues off Ushant, coming
from Rochelle laden with salt, was set upon by a man-of-war
of Algiers having 15 pieces of ordnance and full of men with
the colour of Holland displayed .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then put out her
Turkey colours and bade him 'amain'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> for the King of Algiers,
whereupon this examinant refusing to strike their sails at his
command, the Turk boarded his ship in his quarter with great
store of men, whereby they continued to fight board by board
together by the space of 3 hours, and the Turk being weary
of the battery took occasion to cut away this examinant's
sprit-sail-yard to clear himself away, and then stood to the
northward .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that he killed a great many of the Turks and
beat them out of his top into the sea with his muskets, and
then surprised and brought into this harbour of Poole, one
Turk and three Christians, viz.: a Dutchman, a Frenchman
and a Biscayner." These three men made statements to the
effect that the Turkish ship was of 240 tons displacement,
carried 15 guns and 124 men, of whom 19 were Christians,
6 of them English, and 3 of them renegades, and that thirty
men-of-war from Algiers were "on the war-path" against
Spain, France, and England. The "Dutchman" was one
Oliver Megy of Lübeck, who admitted that he had been
acting as pilot. Dutchman was apparently then used indiscriminately
for Dutch or German, as I believe is still to a
great extent the case at sea.</p>

<p>Then Sir John Pennington, in his <cite>Journal</cite> on board H.M.S.
<i>Vauntguard</i>, in 1633, reports falling in with a "fly-boat",
which informed him that he had been "clapt aboard" by two
Turks, one of eleven, the other of seven guns, "betwixt the
Gulfe and the Land's End, and hurt 9 or 10 of his men very
dangerously, but at last&mdash;God bee praysed&mdash;they got from
them and slew 4 of the Turkes&mdash;that entered them&mdash;outright
and drove the rest overboard". Again, when anchored in the
<i>Swiftsure</i>, in Stokes Bay, Pennington notes on 24th September,
1635: "There came in a freebooter, and in his company
a barke of Dartmouth laden with Poore John (dried fish)
which he tooke in the Channel from a Turks man-of-warr".<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a><br /><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
In 1652, just after the Republican form of government had
been established in England, the <i>Speaker</i> frigate was dispatched
to "Argier in Turkey" with £30,000 to ransom English
captives from slavery. But when the strong hand of the
Protector Cromwell had seized the helm of state there was
no more question of ransoms or presents to the barbarians of
Algiers. He dispatched the celebrated Admiral Blake with a
dozen men-of-war to deal with the Turks in the only effective
way. Blake stood into the harbour of Tunis, burned all the
shipping there, and knocked their fortifications to pieces, with
the loss of only twenty-five killed and forty wounded. He
then appeared before Algiers, whither the story of his victory
at Tunis had preceded him, and had no difficulty in arranging
for the release of the whole of the British captives. More
than this, the "Turks" gave British waters a wide berth, and
there were no more complaints of their performances in the
Narrow Seas during the Protectorate.</p>

<p>But with the re-appearance of the Stuart kings at the
Restoration the old story of outrage and piracy began all over
again. The Turks led off with the sensational capture of Lord
Inchiquin, the British Ambassador to Portugal, who with his
whole suite was captured off the Tagus and publicly sold by
auction in the market-place of Algiers. They would never
have dared to act in this manner in the days of Cromwell and
Blake; but they knew well enough that there was mighty
little patriotism about the "Merry Monarch" and his Court
and Government. But even Charles could not stomach the
degrading arrangement which was made by the Earl of Winchelsea,
the British Ambassador to Turkey, who had been
ordered to call at Algiers on his way out to negotiate a new
treaty with the Dey. This nobleman actually granted the
pirates liberty to search British vessels and remove all foreigners
and their goods. The Earl of Sandwich and Sir John
Lawson were sent with a fleet to Algiers to enforce the
removal of the obnoxious clause from the treaty. They bombarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the town, but apparently not very effectively. The
point was conceded by the Dey, but as the Algerines, like the
modern Huns, regarded all treaties as "scraps of paper", to be
torn up when opportunity offered, the expedition was practically
fruitless.</p>

<p>The Earl of Inchiquin and his son were eventually ransomed
for £1500, and Charles showed his weakness by indulging in
the unfortunately widespread habit of trying to conciliate the
"Turks" by presents of arms and ammunition, which everyone
knew would be used against our own ships and men.</p>

<p>From about this time forward the Turkish pirates seem
to have generally kept farther out in the Atlantic. They
were especially on the look-out for our Newfoundland ships.
In 1677 six corsairs destroyed seventeen of these, but one
of the Turks was terribly mauled by a small English frigate,
and only escaped by the aid of a dark and stormy night.
Our watch-dogs were settling down to their work at last.
The <i>Concord</i> merchantman bound for America had a stiff
fight with a Turkish squadron in 1678, 120 leagues from
the Land's End. One night they fell in with "The Admiral
of Algiers, a new Frigate of 48 guns, called the <i>Rose</i>,
and commanded by Canary, a Spanish renegade; the other
two Virginiamen, the one of Plymouth, the one of Dartmouth",
evidently captured ships. There was also a "barque
of Ireland". "The Algerian hailed us in English," says
Thomas Grantham, master of the <i>Concord</i>, "'From whence?'
We answered, 'From London.' He told us he was the
<i>Rupert</i>, frigate, and commanded our boat on board, which
our Captain refused, knowing it could not be the <i>Rupert</i>.
The Turk kept company with us all night, which gave us
some time to fit our ship, and get our boats out: when it
was light he put abroad his bloody flag<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> at main-topmast head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fires a gun, and commands us to strike to the King of Algiers
and to Admiral Canary.</p>

&quot;His sails, masts, and shrouds were all in a blaze. Then we cut loose, and his mast went by
the board.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"We gave him a 'What cheer ho', he comes up with
us and passes his broadside upon us, having 13 guns of a
side of his lower tier; we returned him as good a salute
as we could; he steered from us, falls astern, loaded his guns
with double head and round partridge,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and then came up
again with us, claps us on board, grapples with us on the
quarter, and made fast his spritsail topmast to our main-bowline,
our main-topsail being furled. After 2 or 3 hours
dispute, finding he could not master us, he cut away our
boats, and fires us on the quarter, and our mizzen-yard
being shot down, fired our sail which burnt very vehemently,
and immediately set all the after-part of our ship on fire.
Our captain kept the round-house and cuddy, till the fire forced
him to retreat, all that were with him being killed or wounded
and being got down into the great cabin steerage, he sallied
out with those that were there with a resolution rather to be
burnt than taken.</p>

<p>"In the interim, the Turk's foresail hanging in the brails
over our poop took fire; then he would fain have got clear
of us, but we endeavoured to keep him fast, and as many
as run up to cut him clear, we fetched down with our small
shot, until his sails, masts, shrouds, and yards, were all in
a blaze; then we cut loose, and immediately his mast to
the deck went by the board, with many men in his top and
his bloody flag; several of the men betook themselves to
their boats, but at last they overcame the fire, as, thanks be
to God, we did likewise on board our ship, having our mizzen-mast
burnt by the board and all the after-part of our ship
burnt; there was little or no wind. The Turk got his oars,
and rowed till he was out of fear of us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We had killed
or wounded on board of us in the action with Canary 21
men, but of Turks, according to the account from aboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
them, at least 70 or 80 are killed." If every merchantman
had put up as good a fight as Captain Thomas Grantham,
the Turks would soon have had to retire from their
piratical business. As it was, they were able to continue
their depredations for some years longer, but not in quite
the same wholesale way. The British Navy became more
and more active, and in 1681-2 made prizes of a number
of Turkish vessels, among them the <i>Admiral of Sally</i>, the
<i>Two Lyons and Crown of Argiers</i>, the <i>Three Half Moons</i>,
the <i>Golden Lyon</i>, and&mdash;what a name for a man-of-war!&mdash;the
<i>Flowerpott</i>. These captures had an immediate effect.
The Algerines became "very inclinable to peace" and offered
to release many English captives "gratis". Their last notable
exploit in British waters was the attempt to capture
a transport in which the Royal Irish Regiment was sailing
from Ostend to Cork in 1695.</p>

<p>The "Turk" in this case was a Salee rover, like the one
that attacked Robinson Crusoe's ship. She gave chase to the
transport and overhauled her, but when she got near enough
to see her decks crowded with redcoats she considered discretion
to be the better part of valour and hauled off. It
is probable that occasional forays were made on our shipping
by such marauders in the early part of the eighteenth century,
and we have a very detailed account of the wreck of the
<i>White Horse</i>, an Algerine frigate, near Penzance, in September,
1740. The return of the greater part of her survivors
to Algiers on board the <i>Blonde</i> frigate is an early instance
of our national weakness for too tenderly dealing with alien
enemies. Slavery had not been abolished; we could easily
and legitimately have sold them for slaves to the West Indian
planters or to the Knights of Malta, or exchanged them for
some of the hundreds of our fellow-countrymen the pirate
cities of North Africa still held in bondage. But no, we
preferred to set them free and to put them in a position to
murder, rob, and enslave yet more Englishmen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The very last appearance of the Turkish pirate in our
waters I have been able to find is of so recent a date as
18th May, 1817, when a couple of Moorish vessels captured
a ship coming from Oldenburgh, off the Galloper Shoal, which
is not far from the Goodwin Sands. This must have been a
very exceptional case, though up to the time Lord Exmouth
subjected Algiers to a severe bombardment the "Turks" were
still a danger to merchantmen in southern waters. The pest
was not stamped out until the capture of the famous pirate city
by the French in 1830. So confident and so truculent were the
Deys of Algiers as late as the early part of the nineteenth
century that, in 1804, even Nelson, in command of a powerful
fleet, was unable to make the Dey give an interview to
Captain Keats of the <i>Superb</i>, whom he had sent as bearer
of a letter setting forth certain British claims. Incredible
to relate, no further steps were taken, and the fleet put to
sea and resumed the blockade of Toulon. We can hardly,
therefore, be surprised to read that in the same year the
"Turks" should have had the hardihood to attack the United
States frigate <i>Philadelphia</i>, which took the ground off Tripoli
when in pursuit of a pirate. The Americans fought for four
hours, but, the ship being by that time almost on her beam
ends, had eventually to strike their colours, and both officers
and men were carried ashore into slavery.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Honour of the Flag</div>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"Ye Mariners of England." <span class="smcap">Thomas Campbell.</span></span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Most</span> people, as they listen to the inspiring strains of "Rule,
Britannia! Britannia rule the waves", feel a wholesome consciousness
of pride and satisfaction in having the privilege
of belonging to a nation whose sons have almost always been
pre-eminent on the ocean; but few stop to consider what is
implied by the expression "rule the waves".</div>

<p>We are not in any doubt at the present moment of at
least one meaning of the words. Had not our fleet instantly
asserted its supremacy at the very outbreak of the great war
with Germany we should have found it very difficult to get
along at all, either with the war or with "business as usual".
Does everybody realize, even now, that the war forced us to
try to do two stupendous things at once&mdash;to carry on the
biggest struggle in our history and to keep going the biggest
trade and commerce in the world? It is quite certain that if
we had not been able to maintain our "ruling of the waves",
we should soon have been in a state of commercial collapse.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the old days our claim to the empire of the sea
was based on other considerations, and though nothing more
important was at stake than what may be termed a question
of precedence, our naval commanders, even in those periods
when our navy was by no means at its best or strongest,
were always prepared to enforce their claims by instant resort
to arms. Strange to say, it is only since our great victory
off Cape Trafalgar that we have abrogated a claim to an
extensive watery kingdom, extending from Cape Van Staten
in Norway to Finisterre in Spain, which for many hundred
years we had fought for, generally maintained, and asserted
in the most imperious manner. According to old writers on
the subject, even the Saxon kings had claimed the kingship
of the "Narrow Seas", which then probably meant what is
now the English Channel. This, in the time of our Norman
kings, was actually a channel through their dominions, and
when, by his marriage to the daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine,
Henry II eventually succeeded to that duchy, and extended
his dominions to the south-east corner of the Bay of
Biscay, he naturally felt he had a claim to rule the seas still
farther to the south.</p>

<p>"The striking of the sail" (that is, lowering it) "is one
of the ancientest prerogatives of the Crown of England," says
an old writer, "and in the second year of King John, it was
declared at Hastings by that Monarch, for a law and custom
of the sea, that if a Lieutenant on any voyage, being ordained
by the King, encounter upon the sea any ship or vessel, laden
or unladen, that will not strike or vail their bonnets<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> at the
commandment of the Lieutenant of the King, or of the Admiral
of the King, or his Lieutenant, but will fight against them
of the fleet, that if they can be taken they shall be reputed
as enemies; their ships, vessels, and goods taken and forfeited
as the goods of enemies; and that the common people being in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the same, be chastised by imprisonment of their bodies." The
same writer states that this claim was formally recognized and
accepted in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Edward I
(1297) "by the Agents and Ambassadors of Genoa, Catalonia,
Spain, Almaigne, Zealand, Holland, Friesland, Denmark, Norway,
and divers other places in the Empire, and by all the
States and Princes of Europe".</p>

<p>There do not seem to have been any definite limitations to
our watery kingdom laid down: it is sometimes convenient not
to be too precise. But the earliest claim was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad finem
terrae</i>, which might mean to the "Land's End", to "Finisterre"
in Brittany, to "Finisterre" in Spain, or "to the ends
of the earth"&mdash;all very different things. Certainly the
Spanish Finisterre was regarded as the southern boundary in
the seventeenth century, for in the Rev. H. Teonge's <cite>Diary</cite>,
when chaplain in the <i>Royal Oak</i>, we find the following entry
written after leaving Gibraltar for England: "13 May, 1679&mdash;An
indifferent good gale, and fayre weather, and at twelve
wee are in the King of England's dominions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo gratia</i>), that
is wee are past Cape Finister and entering on the Bay of Biscay".</p>

<p>Monarch after monarch asserted his right to be saluted by
foreigners "taking in their flag and striking their topsail"
when within "His Majesty's Seas", and the Protector Cromwell
made the same claim on behalf of the nation. Our
men-of-war had also to be saluted in the same way by our
merchant-ships. Any neglect used to be summarily punished.
Captain Pennington of H.M.S. <i>Vauntguard</i> notes in his <cite>Journal</cite>
that on 6th September, 1633, he had "in the Bilbowes" (that
is, fastened by the legs to an iron bar running along the deck)
"Richard Eastwood, Master of a Sandwich hoye, for not
striking his topsayle"! He does not say how long he kept
him there, or whether he handed him over to the civil power
to be prosecuted by the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Not only the sea but "all that therein is" was considered
the property of the English monarchs. Foreigners were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
allowed to fish without permission, for which they generally
had to pay. This was relaxed under Henry VI, but reasserted
later, and the enforcement of payment from Dutch
fishermen for fishing in the North Sea was one of the prime
causes of the wars between Holland and England in the time
of the Commonwealth and of Charles II. For the Dutch
thought they were strong enough to wrest the trident of Neptune
from our grasp. They nearly succeeded, but not quite, and
we find William III asserting our claim to sovereignty afloat
just as particularly and definitely as any of his predecessors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i150.jpg" width="600" height="370" alt="painting sea fight with many ships" />
<div class="caption">TEACHING THE SPANIARD &quot;THE HONOUR OF THE FLAG&quot;<br />

<p>Philip of Spain, arriving in the Straits of Dover on his journey to England to espouse Mary, flaunts the flag of Spain without paying the customary
salute. Lord Howard of Effingham, the English admiral, soon brings him to his senses by firing a round shot across his bows.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The officers in command of royal ships or fleets were not
expected to refer the matter to higher authority, but were
to take action at once, and made no bones about doing so.
Innumerable instances may be quoted&mdash;the only difficulty is
to pick out the most interesting cases. Nor were they respectors
of persons. When the gloomy and saturnine Philip
of Spain arrived in British waters, on his way to espouse our
Queen Mary, he came with great pomp and circumstance with
a fleet of 100 sail, flaunting the gaudy flag of Spain even
in the Straits of Dover. Lord Howard of Effingham, sent
with a guard of honour of 28 men-of-war to meet the Prince
Consort elect, had no idea of allowing that even in this very
special case, and, seeing no disposition on the part of the
Spanish fleet to pay the customary salute, lost no time in
sending over a gentle reminder in the shape of a round shot.</p>

<p>The hint was taken, and not till then did Howard go on
board to pay his respects to King Philip. Not many years
later a Spanish fleet which was on its way to Flanders, to
bring Anne of Austria back to Spain, tried it on again on
entering Plymouth. Here they found Admiral Hawkins flying
his flag on board the <i>Jesus of Lubeck</i>&mdash;a ship, by the way,
that had taken part in the Armada fight. Hawkins was not
slow in sending the usual reminder humming through the
Spanish admiral's rigging, and, as he still hesitated to "take
in his flag", a second messenger came crashing into his ship's
side. Still trying to avoid paying the usual compliment,
he went personally on board the <i>Jesus</i> to argue the point.
He might have spared his pains. All the satisfaction he got
was a peremptory order to clear out of our seas within twelve
hours as a penalty for his rudeness to the Queen.</p>

<p>Again, off Calais, the French ambassador was made to
render the proper salute to our admiral of the Narrow Seas,
who gave orders to Sir Jerome Turner, his second in command,
to "shoot and strike him", should he refuse to do so.
In 1605 Sir William Monson had a slight difficulty with a
Dutch admiral at the same place. The Dutchmen dipped his
flag three times, but Monson insisted that he should pay the
ordained salute and take it in altogether, or fight the matter
out on the spot. The salute was paid.</p>

<p>Even in the days of James I, when our fleet was in somewhat
a poor way, its captains insisted as firmly as ever on the
customary honour being paid to our flag. Captain Best of
the <i>Guardland</i> sends in a report about two Dutch men-of-war
off Aberdeen, and says: "The Admiral of the Holland men-of-war
hath his flag in her main-top, but giveth it out that he
will not take it in for all the Commanders of His Majesty's
ships. Forty years is within the compass of my knowledge,
and I never knew but that all nations forbear to spread their
flags in the presence of the King's ships. That custom shall
not be lost by me. When I come into the road and anchor
by him, if the Admiral will not take in his flag when I shall
require it, I will shoot it down, though it grow into a quarrel."
The last expression is delightful. There certainly would have
been the makings of a "quarrel". This was in 1623.</p>

<p>Captain Richard Plumleigh took an even wider view of
the obligations of foreigners to pay honour to the English
flag. His idea was that they had to do so even in foreign
harbours. He writes to the Admiralty on 23rd September,
1631: "It was my fortune to speak with one of these two
merchants from whom the French demanded their flag".<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
That is to say that the French had what he regarded as the
impertinence to expect that they should have "struck" their
topsails to them. He goes on: "They shot at the English
some dozen shots and received from the English the like
entertainment, with the loss of one man, by which they sat
down and gave over their pretences.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It hath always
been my principal aim to preserve His Majesty's Naval honnour
both in his own seas and abroad, and for my part I think
that it were better that both I and the ship under my charge
were at the bottom of the sea, than that I should live to see
a Frenchman or any other nation wear a flag aloft in His
Majesty's seas and suffer them to pass unfought withal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I dare engage my head that with five of H.M. ships I will
always clear the way to all French flagmasters, yea, and
make them strike to him upon those which they call their
own seas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This summer I was at the Texel in Holland,
where come in divers French, and though the Hollanders bade
me domineer at home in England, yet I forebore not to fetch
down their flag with my ordnance." Evidently the gallant
captain had strong views on the subject, and did not hide
them under a bushel. But he was not alone in his determination
to uphold the "honnour of the flag" at all costs.</p>

<p>Pennington, a notable naval officer of that period, has
several incidents of a similar kind to relate in his <cite>Journals</cite>
on board H.M.S. <i>Convertive</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> <i>Vauntguard</i>, and <i>Swiftsure</i>, between
1631 and 1636. He tells us that sailing in the first-mentioned
ship, together with the <i>Assurance</i> and a couple
of small vessels known as "whelps"&mdash;in search of "Rovers and
Pyrates"&mdash;he met a fleet of eleven Dutch men-of-war in Dover
Roads, "whereof two were soe stoute that they would not so
much as settle their topp-sayles untill wee made a shott at
each of them, soe&mdash;they doinge their dutyes&mdash;wee stood on
our course". A few days later "There came up 4 Dunkerke
men-of-warr unto us, who in all submissive wise, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
topp-sayles and top-gallant sayles lowrd upon the capp,
saluted us accordinge to the custome of the sea"!</p>

<p>All this seems summary and drastic enough for anybody,
so that it is curious to find the celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh
not long before lamenting British decadence in this respect.
"But there's no state grown in haste but that of the United
Provinces, and especially in their sea forces.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For I myself
may remember when one ship of Her Majesty's would have
made forty Hollanders strike sail and come to an anchor.
They did not then dispute <i>De Mare Libero</i>, but readily acknowledged
the English to be <i>Domini Maris Britannici</i>.
That we are less powerful than we were I do hardly believe it;
for, although we have not at this time 135 ships belonging to
the subject of 500 tons each ship, as it is said we had in the
twenty-fourth year of Queen Elizabeth; at which time also,
upon a general view and muster, there were found in England
of able men fit to bear arms, 1,172,000, yet are our merchant
ships now far more warlike and better appointed than they
were, and the Royal Navy double as strong as it then was."</p>

<p>Possibly Raleigh's words had borne fruit in increased
vigilance on the part of the captains of English men-of-war.
But the Hollanders were determined to put the matter to the
test. Possibly they thought that as there was no King of
England after the martyrdom of Charles I there could be no
king of the English seas. They began by forbidding their
captains to pay the usual salute under pain of death. It was
not long before Van Tromp sailed defiantly through Dover
Straits with all his flags aloft. He got what he was asking
for, a volley of round shot from Robert Blake, who was on the
look-out for him, and at once both fleets went for each other
"tooth and nail". The Dutch were beaten, but in a second
encounter&mdash;for by now English and Dutch were openly at war&mdash;Blake
got the worst of it, and was driven into the Thames to
refit. "Tromp meanwhile sailed up and down the Channel as
a conqueror, with a broom at his mast-head, thus braving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
English navy in those very seas in which she claimed unrivalled
sovereignty".<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<span class="caption">THE BATTLE OF THE NORE, JUNE 1653, BETWEEN THE ENGLISH AND DUTCH</span>

<p>But his triumph was short-lived. The British eventually
got the upper hand, and their claims to the sovereignty of
their seas were formally admitted by the Dutch in 1654.
Once again the question was fought out in the days of
Charles II, and once again the Dutch were compelled to agree
to strike their sails to even a single ship flying the King's flag.
This was in 1674. Not long before the first Dutch War the
Swedes also wished to question British rights. In 1647
Captain Owen of the <i>Henrietta Maria</i>, having with him only
the <i>Roebuck</i>, a small craft, with a crew of forty-five men all
told, was refused the salute by a fleet of three Swedish men-of-war
and nine or ten merchant-vessels off the Isle of Wight.
The usual "weighty arguments" were ignored, and the Swedes
got away and anchored in Boulogne Roads. Captain Owen
was unable to keep in touch with them, as they had shot away
his tiller, but he got into Portsmouth and reported the matter,
and the Parliament at once ordered the <i>St. Andrew</i>, <i>Guardland</i>,
<i>Convertine</i>, and <i>Mary Rose</i>, which were lying in the
Downs, to attend to the matter. Captain Batten, of the first-named
ship, who was in command, at once put to sea, and
found the Swedes still at anchor off Boulogne, but flying no
colours at all. Batten sent for the Swedish commanders to
come on board&mdash;and they came, but declared that if their flags
<em>had</em> been up they would not have taken them in, as they had
been expressly ordered not to do so. It was rather a difficult
situation. Captain Batten, however, dealt with it by ordering
the Swedish vice-admiral to "come with him", and took him
back to the Downs. He told the remainder to "run away
home". However, they followed the English and their prisoners
to the Downs, as their commanders said that they dare
not go home without the vice-admiral. The affair was then
considered by "the Committee of Lords and Commons for the
Admiralty and Cinque Ports", who eventually gave an order
for the release of the culprit.</p>

<p>Other nations from time to time attempted to exact salutes
from foreign ships in certain places, but apparently without
much success. Thus the Spanish demanded that a French
fleet under the Duke of Guise when passing Gibraltar in
1622 should strike their flags. The Duke refused, though he
said that they had told him that British ships were in the
habit of doing so, and he asked Sir E. Herbert to write and
ask the Duke of Buckingham whether this was true or not.
But Herbert smelt a rat; and though he complied with Guise's
request, he wrote: "Be well advised what answer you return,
for I believe that he intends that the French king should
exact the same acknowledgements on the coasts of this
country, which you will never permit, as to the prejudice of
the sovereignty that the Kings of England have always kept
in the narrow seas." As regards the Mediterranean, it was
laid down by James II, to prevent disputes with "the most
Christian King",<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> "That whensoever His Majesty's ships of
war shall meet any French men-of-war in the Mediterranean,
there shall no salutes at all pass on either side". William
III's orders were&mdash;after the usual directions to make foreigners
pay the customary salute in the English seas&mdash;"And you
are further to take notice, that in Their Majesties' Seas, Their
Majesties' Ships are in no wise to strike to any; and that in
other parts, no ship of Their Majesties' is to strike her flag
or top-sail to any foreigner unless such foreigner shall have
first struck."</p>

<p>A final incident must bring this chapter to a close. It
indicates a slightly farther step towards the evacuation of the
original position which we had taken up. This was in the
year 1730. Lieutenant Thomas Smith, R.N., happened to be
in temporary command of H.M.S. <i>Gosport</i>, which was lying in
Plymouth Sound. In came a French frigate, which, either on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a><br /><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
account of ignorance or of design, omitted to strike her top-sails.
Smith, having so many precedents to guide him, though
possibly not very recent ones, sent the usual intimation by
hulling her with a cannon-ball. It was at a time of profound
peace, and on the demand of the French ambassador he was
tried and dismissed the Service. Plumleigh and Pennington
must have turned in their graves! But he was re-appointed to
the Navy on the very next day, with the rank of captain, and
for the rest of his life was known as "Tom of Ten Thousand".</p>

<p>The old regulations remained in force up to the end of the
eighteenth century, but were omitted from those that were
published about the Trafalgar period. The orders given by
William III for guidance of officers when <em>outside</em> English seas
were made universal, so that for some unknown reason we
finally abandoned our claims at the very time we were in a
better position to enforce them than we had ever been before.
The old system rather partook of the way the proverbial
Irishman in search of "divarsion" asks "if any gintleman
will be good enough to thread on the tail of his coat", but it
had its advantages. Had it been now in force it is practically
certain that some German commander would have challenged
it long before the German fleet had reached its present proportions,
after which there would have been no German fleet.
Again, there could have been no difficulties with neutral
nations about contraband or conditional contraband. As the
whole sea from Norway to Finisterre would have been recognized
as British, no one could have disputed our right to close
it to anybody or anything that suited our book. When it
comes to fighting, other nations do not thank us for having
played "Uriah Heep" beforehand. It has possibly induced
them to fight instead of settling the dispute in some other way.</p>

<p>"Striking the sail" is now a thing of the past, but it is
customary for merchant-vessels to "dip" their flags to kings'
ships. As for men-of-war, they no longer exchange salutes
of this kind when they meet at sea.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Who</span> invented gunpowder?" There is only one definite
and reliable answer to this question, and that is that nobody
knows. It has been stated, but I think that it may be dismissed
as a "galley yarn", that the first mention of artillery
is to be found in an account of a naval engagement between
the Ph&#339;nicians and Iberians in the year 1100 <span class='small'>B.C.</span>&mdash;just
eighty-seven years after the siege of Troy.</div>

<p>The Ph&#339;nician war-vessels, it is said, came out of Cadiz&mdash;or
Gades, as it was then called&mdash;with what their opponents
took to be brazen lions at their bows. These turned out to
be some kind of machine from which enormous flames of fire
were projected by explosives, to consume and destroy the ships
of the Iberians. But the most generally accepted theory now
is that gunpowder was invented in China some centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
before the Christian era and gradually found its way to Europe
by way of India, Arabia, and Africa. As for the stories that
it was invented either by Roger Bacon (1214-92) or by the
German monk, Barthold Schwartz, in 1320, they must be certainly
rejected, since there is evidence that cannon of some kind
were in use long previous to Roger Bacon's birth. Doubtless he
wrote something about the composition of gunpowder, but so
might anyone to-day. That would not make him its inventor.</p>

<p>Much less, then, can this invention be attributed to the
German monk. It is probably correct that, in pounding
certain ingredients in a mortar, he nearly blew himself "into
the middle of next week"&mdash;as very many would-be chemical
investigators have done at a much more recent date&mdash;and
it may be that the sight of his pestle flying through the
ceiling suggested to him that a mortar might be made of
military use.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He may possibly, on this account, be credited
with the invention of the muzzle-loading cannon, for it seems
probable that the guns in use previous to 1320 were merely
<i>cannae</i>, or tubes open at each end. The famous battery of
three guns, which is said by some historians to have been
used by the English at Crécy, was probably of this kind.
Whether the guns were used there or not, it would not have
been the first time such weapons made their appearance in
European warfare, as seems to be assumed by some writers.</p>

<p>More than 100 years previously cannon were employed
by the Moors at the siege of Saragossa, in 1118. The Spaniards
were not slow to adopt the invention, and in 1132 they built
what is stated to have been a "culverin" throwing a 4-pound
shot. "Culverin", which is a term, belonging to Tudor times,
for a special type of gun, is evidently used as a general term
for "cannon". Like the "Joe Chamberlain" and "Bloody
Mary",<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> manned by the Naval Brigade in the Boer War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and other prominent specimens of the gun-maker's art, this
first European cannon received a special name. It was
christened "Salamonica". I have said that the Spaniards
"built" this weapon. I wrote this advisedly, for all the
earlier cannon were "built up" of staves of iron, or even
wood, strongly hooped together with wrought-iron rings.</p>

<p>It was a long time before cannon were "founded" or
"cast", and now, strange to say, we have gone back to the
original method of manufacture, which, thanks to modern
science and workmanship, has absolutely ousted what was
at its inception considered a wonderful advance in the art
of cannon-making. The early guns, open at both ends, were
probably loaded at the breech, which was then closed by a
block of stone or big stake driven into the ground, close to
which the gun itself was fixed in some kind of a framework.
Such guns are to be seen in a picture in Froissart's <cite>Chronicles</cite>
representing the siege of Tunis by the Crusaders in 1390,
and it is from this that the often-reproduced drawing of the
guns said to have been used at Crécy in 1346 would appear to
have been taken.</p>

<p>What is said to be the earliest representation of a cannon in
England is to be found in a manuscript of 1326 in the Christ
Church Library at Oxford. It is of quite a different appearance
from those just described. It is in the shape of a fat vase
or bottle, and could not well have been a breech-loader. It
is loaded with a big "garot" or dart fitted with a wooden
haft which seems to fit tightly into the neck of the weird
"cannon", which lies on a very rickety looking table. The
gunner, clad in what looks like a suit of Crusader's chain-mail,
is an unwary person who is holding a lighted match
to the touch-hole while standing directly behind the gun.
As there is not the slightest indication of anything whatever
to stop the recoil, it seems about three to one that the discharge
would be more disastrous to him than to the enemy.
It is noteworthy that "metal cannons" and "iron balls" were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
ordered to be made in this same year at Florence, and in
1331 <em>vase</em> appears to have been the usual term for the
cannon made in Italy, while in France they were termed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pots de fer</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i163.jpg" width="350" height="239" alt="diagram or drawing of old cannon type gun" />
<div class="caption">A &quot;Vase&quot; or &quot;Pot-de-fer&quot;<br />

<p>The &quot;garot&quot;, or heavy dart, to be fired from this early gun was provided with
a wooden plug made to fit the bore. The type of &quot;garot&quot; shown on the right was
intended to be fired from a large cross-bow on a stand.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This brings us to the earliest indication that I can find
of the use of guns afloat. It is a document dated 1338, in
which Guillaume du Moulin, of Boulogne, acknowledges to
have received from Thomas Fouques, the custodian of the
enclosure for the King's galleys at Rouen, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot-de-fer</i> to
throw "fire garots", together with forty-eight garots in two
cases, 1 pound of saltpetre, and ½ pound of sulphur "to make
powder to fire the said garots". Now it seems more than
probable that this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot-de-fer</i> or <em>vase</em> was very similar to that
in the Oxford manuscript and that it was intended for use
afloat, or it would not have been among the stores belonging
to the galleys. The recipient being at Boulogne, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
fairly assume that it was required by him for use on shipboard.
"Garots", we know, were very commonly used in
naval actions at this date, either thrown by hand from the
tops or propelled from espringalds. Moreover, it is evident
that the gun open at both ends would be a great source of
danger on board ship. The system of breech-closing on shore
was singularly rough and ineffective; there must have been
nearly as much "back-fire" at the breech as flames from the
muzzle. This would be a constant danger afloat, and, unless
a few <em>vases</em> like those described were sometimes used, it is
probable that cannon were not adopted for sea service until
some more regular and effective breech-closing apparatus had
been evolved. But for this seamen had not very long to wait.</p>

<p>The progress of gun-making was now proceeding apace,
especially in Germany and Flanders. At first, and for some
time, there do not seem to have been any what we may call
"moderate-sized" cannon, or, at any rate, they are not so
much in evidence as the very large ones and the very small
ones. The latter were not bigger than very heavy muskets,
and it was with weapons of this kind that the many-gunned
ships of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century were
principally equipped, though, as time went on, heavier pieces
were added. To show how very small these little cannon
were, it is only necessary to quote from Monstrelet's <cite>Chronicles</cite>,
in which he tells us that, in 1418: "The Lord of Cornwall .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. crossed
the Seine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. having with him in a <em>skiff</em> a <em>horse
loaded with small cannons</em>". When one reads of the extraordinary
numbers of guns which are said to have been used
in some mediæval battles and sieges, one should always bear
this passage in mind.</p>


<p>As for the big guns, they were giants when compared
with their smaller brothers. Old Froissart, whom I have
already quoted more than once, tells of a very notable specimen
employed by the "men of Ghent" to attack Oudenarde:
"A marvellous great bombarde, which was fifty feet long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and threw great heavy stones of a wonderful bigness; when
this bombarde was discharged, it might be heard five leagues
by day, and ten at night, making so great a noise in going
off, that it seemed as if all the devils in hell were abroad".
All traces of this monster have disappeared, but an 18-feet
gun of probably an exactly similar type is still to be seen
at Ghent&mdash;unless the Germans have stolen it. This gun dates
from about 1384, and has a bore something like 25 inches in
diameter. As perhaps none of us are likely to be in Ghent
for some time, we can see a rather smaller but almost
duplicate weapon in Edinburgh&mdash;the celebrated "Mons Meg".
Though she is supposed to have been built 100 years later,
it is quite possible that both were turned out at the same
manufactory. The Scots gun evidently came from Mons in
Flanders, and the Flemish gun is also called "Meg", i.e. the
<i>Dulle Griete</i> or "Mad Margery" or "Meg". Another bigger
and more handsomely finished gun of the same type, dating
from 1464, is to be seen at the Royal Artillery Museum at
Woolwich. This is a Turkish piece, and is said to have been
"cast", while "Mons Meg" and her sisters are all built-up
guns, as can be at once seen on inspection by the most amateur
eyes. There are several others on the Continent, notably the
two "Michelets" which were left at Mont St. Michael when
the siege of that place was abandoned by the English in
1427. The siege began in 1423, so they may date from a
good many years earlier. As the English batteries were
erected on the Isle of Tombelaine, which is 3000 yards distant
from the mount, some idea may be obtained of the distance to
which these early cannon could hurl their granite projectiles.</p>

THE <i>DULLE GRIETE</i> AT GHENT<br />

<p>This gun dates from 1384, and is very similar to the &quot;marvellous great bombard&quot; mentioned by Froissart as employed by the men
of Ghent to attack Oudenarde.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i168.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="drawing of a cannon" />
<div class="caption">The Gun with which we won the Great War with France<br />

<p>Observe the heavy breeching-rope attaching the gun to the ship's side; the tackle
and block for running in and out; the wooden wheels, and the &quot;quoins&quot; or wedges for
elevating the gun.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Such cannon were all built up of long rectangular bars
of iron upon which heavy rings of the same material were
shrunk, the whole weapon, on completion, forming a heavy
and extremely tough cylinder of wrought iron. The chambers,
or breech-pieces, for the reception of the powder-charge, were
built separately, with much thicker sides and smaller bores
than the rest of the gun, into which they were screwed.
The guns must not, I think, be therefore considered breech-loaders;
for though it may be possible that they were screwed
in and out at each discharge, I think it more probable that,
as they were such heavy masses of metal, the breech-pieces
were left screwed up and the charges inserted at the muzzle.
But when cannon came to be made of more moderate dimensions&mdash;big
enough to be effective against walls and the sides
of ships, and small enough to be transported with reasonable
facility&mdash;some system of breech-loading was almost universal.
I say "almost", because guns began to be cast in brass in
Germany at a comparatively early date, and such guns were
probably often muzzle-loaders, since cast brass would not
have been strong enough for the breech-closing methods in
vogue. These were comparatively simple. The breech of the
gun, which was built up much in the same way as Mons
Meg and others of the same kidney, terminated in a species
of trough. Into this trough fitted an iron cylinder which
contained the charge of powder and was called a "chamber".
The muzzle of the chamber was bevelled off or turned down
so as to fit into the breech end of the bore of the gun itself,
and was held in position by iron wedges, generally at the
rear end, but sometimes across the top. In some of the larger
types the trough was made in the huge block of tough oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to which the gun was fastened. In the Tower of London
you can see a gun of this kind that was fished up from the
wreck of the <i>Mary Rose</i>. As most guns were provided with
at least two "chambers", one would imagine that a fairly
rapid fire could have been kept up, at any rate with the
smaller guns. This, however, would not seem to have been
the case, for the French account of the battle off St. Helens
(when the <i>Mary Rose</i> capsized), which lasted for two hours,
and in which a considerable number of ships were engaged,
mentions that 300 rounds were fired as a fact indicating the
uncommon fierceness of the fighting. And yet the <i>Henri
Grace à Dieu</i> alone carried over 100 guns of various sizes!</p>

<p>But at first, even at a time when artillery of one kind
or another was in common use on land, very few guns were
carried afloat. Very likely the reason was that few were
suitable; they were either too big, too small, or, as before
suggested, could not be safely closed at the breech. Thus
in the reign of Henry IV, 1399-1413, the <i>Christopher</i>, a rather
important man-of-war, only carried "three iron guns with
five chambers, one hand-gun, and one small barrel of powder".
The barge <i>Mary</i> (<i>Marie de la Tour</i>) carried one iron gun
with two chambers and one brass gun with one chamber.
Another <i>Mary</i> (of Weymouth) had also one brass and one
iron gun, the <i>Bernard</i> had two iron guns, and a ship referred
to as the <i>Carrake</i> one. The <i>Christopher's</i> guns are said to
have been "stoked". This may possibly mean fitted with
"stocks" or oaken beds, like those previously referred to,
in which case her guns were probably larger and heavier
than those in the other ships. The invention of port-holes
was probably coincident with the adoption of really heavy
artillery afloat. Before then it would not have been safe to
have carried such heavy weights on the upper decks of the
kind of ship then existing. The <i>Great Michael</i> may possibly be
taken as an exception, for she could hardly have had port-holes
cut in her 10-foot thick sides. At the same time, since her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
heavy guns were probably breech-loaders, they may have been
practically built into her sides, since at that time there was no
such thing as training a heavy gun right or left on board ship.</p>

<p>With the numerous batteries of small guns also carried
on board ships of this period, it was quite a different matter.
They were mounted on swivels on the gunwale, or in openings
or ports in the fore- and after-castles as well as in
the tops. Others, and among them certain wide-mouthed
pieces known as "murderers", were distributed in what were
known as the "cubbridge heads", or those sides of the fore-
and after-castles which faced inboard and commanded the
waist of the ship. Here it was to be expected an enemy's
boarders would make their assault, and here&mdash;the crew having
retired fore and aft&mdash;they would be mowed down by charges
of all sorts of iron fragments from the "murderers". The
same system of dealing with boarders lasted some time after
the disappearance of the lofty "castles" at bow and stern;
strong athwart-ships bulkheads being provided at bow and
stern both on the upper and main decks.</p>

<p>It was in Henry VIII's time that the manufacture of cast-iron
guns, for which England soon became famous, began in
this country. One Ralph Hogge,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> at Buxted, in Sussex, cast
the first iron cannon. This is said to have been in 1543,
and it is stated that the house in which this was done is
still standing near the church of that village, and that it
has the figure of a hog with the date 1581 carved over the
door. There is another story to the effect that this early
gunfounder's name was John Howe, and that there is the
following distich, cut in stone, still extant in Buxted:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I, John Howe, and my man John,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We two cast the first cannon".</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>This invention may be said to have sealed the fate of the
heavy breech-loading gun for some centuries, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
system remained in vogue for small pieces for another 200
years. A cast-iron or brass muzzle-loading gun could be
made so much more easily, rapidly, and cheaply than a built-up
wrought-iron breech-loader of the same calibre that with
the growing demand for guns afloat there is little wonder
that the former drove the more expensive weapon clean out
of the field. It must be remembered, too, that the casting
of bronze guns had already reached great perfection on the
Continent. What is known as "Queen Elizabeth's pocket
pistol" at Dover is a standing witness to this. It is supposed
to have been cast at Utrecht, and to have been presented to
Henry VIII by the Emperor Charles V in 1544. It is 24 feet
long, and is a very fine piece of workmanship. Its bore is
58 calibres long&mdash;that is to say, it is fifty-eight times as
long as its diameter, a proportion not very unlike that upon
which some of our most modern weapons are designed.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i171.jpg" width="500" height="215" alt="drawing or diagram of another cannon" />
<div class="caption">Early Breech-loading Cannon<br />

<p>The first was an Armada weapon. This type of gun remained in use afloat
well into the eighteenth century</p></div>
</div>

<p>But to return to our early naval cannon. As I have
already pointed out, the casting of bronze guns in Germany
and Flanders had reached a great pitch of perfection long
before anything of the sort was made in England. Germany,
in fact, may be said to have led in gunnery for a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
period. The master gunners in most armies seem to have
been Germans, and at the accession of Queen Elizabeth we
were buying our powder from the German Hansa Company
established in the Steel Yard in London, instead of making
sufficient for ourselves. There were many brass guns afloat
in Henry VIII's navy besides the wrought-iron breech-loaders.
Some of fine workmanship were found in the wreck of the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, as well as those of the latter class which have
been already mentioned. As an indication of the cost and
labour expended on such weapons, it may be instanced that
a bronze gun cast in Germany in 1406 took from Whitsuntide
to Michaelmas to finish, and required 52½ hundredweight of
copper and 3½ hundredweight of tin. The metal cost 422
florins, while the master gun-founder received 86 florins for
his pains.</p>

<p>The heaviest weapon afloat in Tudor times was the curtall
or curtow, generally of brass, and firing a 60-pound shot.
The culverin was rather lighter and longer. There were
a whole host of fancy names&mdash;and doubtless fancy types&mdash;for
ordnance at this time, several of which have already been
referred to as forming the armament of the <i>Great Michael</i>.
Space forbids further enumeration or description, which, in
any case, would be impossible on account of the very different
guns which are called indiscriminately by the same name.
But by the Armada days the following were the principal
guns used afloat:&mdash;</p>

<div class='unindent'>The "double cannon" is sometimes called a "cannon royal"
or a "carthoun". The "saker" is often spelt "sacre". The
"culverin"&mdash;a name that occurs rather more frequently than
any other at this time&mdash;was so called from the lugs or handles
for hoisting it in and out of its carriage, which were made in
the form of an ornamental serpent.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></div>

<p>Although the English cast-iron cannon almost at once
achieved such a reputation that they sold in Amsterdam
for £40 a ton, for £60 in France, and for no less than £80
in Spain, though costing only £12 a ton in this country;
and though they were bought so freely at these high prices
by foreigners that in 1574 their export was totally forbidden,
yet it would appear that the Royal Navy was then using
nothing but brass guns, except perhaps in the case of the
smaller pieces. But the merchantmen used iron guns. Thus
when James I sent an expedition of six men-of-war and a
dozen armed merchant-ships against the Algerines in 1620,
all the former carried brass and all the latter iron guns. The
men-of-war were heavily gunned, so much so, indeed, that
it was not unusual for their captains to dismount a few of
their heaviest pieces and stow them as ballast for the safety
of the ship. The <i>Prince Royal</i>, for instance, carried a battery
of two "cannon perriers" (i.e. throwing stone shot), six demi-cannon,
twelve culverins, thirteen sakers, and four light pieces.
The famous <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> in the next reign mounted
twenty cannon, eight demi-cannon, thirty-two culverins, and
forty-two demi-culverins&mdash;all brass guns&mdash;and probably some
small iron falconets as well. On each gun was engraved the
rose and crown, the sceptre and trident, anchor and cable.
The engraving cost £3 per gun, but we must remember that
the <i>Sovereign</i> was a "show ship".</p>

<p>According to an artilleryman who wrote in the first half
of the seventeenth century, three shots an hour was about as
much as an ordinary gun would stand, "always provided that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
after 40 shots you refresh and cool the piece<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and let her rest
an houre, for fear lest 80 shots should break the piece". But
I think we may credit our seamen with being able to fire
their guns a bit faster than that. Constant running out of
powder seems to have been the great trouble in the English
fleet engaged in the discomfiture of the "Invincible" Armada.
And not only did the English ships carry heavier ordnance
and fire heavier broadsides than the Spaniards, so that the
British cannon "lacked them through and through", but our
gunners are said to have fired their pieces three times to the
Spaniards' one. This is a Spanish estimate, and it is abundantly
evident that our gunnery proved at least as superior
as it did over that of the Germans in Sir David Beatty's
victory off the Friesland coast in January, 1915. Later on, at
the battle of La Hogue (1692) the British ships were able to
fire three broadsides to every two of the French.</p>

<div class="caption">Early Attempts at Maxim Guns<br />

<p>In all probability each barrel of the first gun had to be loaded separately and fired
by hand, one after another. In the second case, the eight little cannon are apparently
secured to a kind of turntable, to be revolved by hand.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Coming to the navy of the Commonwealth, we find the
same curiously named guns in use. Here is the battery of
the <i>Naseby:</i> Nineteen cannon, nine demi-cannon, twenty-eight
culverins, thirty demi-culverins, and five sakers. The
same classification lasted till the time of George I, when it
became the custom to designate guns by the weights of their
projectiles. Thenceforward we find ship-armaments reckoned
in 42-pounders, 32-pounders, 24-pounders, 12-pounders, and
6-pounders. The old 60-pounder had disappeared, and before
long the 42-pounder followed it into temporary oblivion, so
that at Trafalgar our heaviest gun was a 32-pounder.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It was
not until nearly 1840 that it reappeared, and was followed by
a 68-pounder.</p>

<p>During the period between Elizabeth and Trafalgar there
were innumerable attempts to invent and introduce improved
forms of ordnance, including shell-guns and machine-guns.
The idea of the latter was extremely ancient. There are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
manuscript illuminations and old wood-cuts of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries showing attempts at a "Maxim" gun.
The "orgue", consisting of a large number of very small guns
or musket-barrels fixed in rows, or revolving rings, or bundles,
was a common weapon in those centuries&mdash;at least on shore.
Then there was something of the kind for which William
Drummond was given a patent in 1625, and which he termed
a "thunder carriage". Again, there was one Puckle, who
in 1781 invented a regular revolving gun mounted on a
tripod. It was made in two patterns&mdash;one to fire ordinary
round bullets, the other to fire square ones&mdash;against the "unspeakable
Turk". Puckle thought these infidels ought to get
as nasty a wound as possible. With his specification he
issued a doggerel which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Defending King George, your country and Lawes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is defending yourselves and Protestant Cause".</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The invention did not "catch on", and under a picture of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
weapon which appeared on the eight of spades in a pack of
cards of the period was another attempt at poetry:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"A rare Invention to destroy the Crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of Fools at Home, instead of Foes Abroad.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fear not, my Friends, this terrible Machine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They're only wounded that have Shares therein".</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Neither machine-guns nor shell-guns were to appear before
the Victorian Era, the reason probably being that there was no
machinery capable of turning them and their component parts
out in payable quantities. As for shell-guns, mortars were
found to answer very well; no navy wanted to introduce a
form of warfare that would be absolutely destructive of
wooden shipping, and so we find that they did not long
precede the appearance of the modern ironclad. But towards
the end of the eighteenth century a new and practical weapon
was invented by General Melville with the idea of producing
a gun which should fire a comparatively large projectile for
its weight. To effect this, something, of course, had to be
sacrificed, and this was length, both of the gun itself and of
its range and also penetration. But, as naval actions then
took place at close quarters, this did not count for much,
and what was lost in penetration was more than made up for
by the smashing effect of the heavy shot. In fact, the gun
itself was at first termed a "smasher", but, from the fact that
most of them were cast at the famous Carron foundry in
Scotland, they soon became universally known as "carronades".</div>

<p>In the days of wooden ships the "carronade" became a
most useful weapon. The smaller kind were light, took up
little space, and were just the things for merchant-men and
small craft; while the bigger class&mdash;generally 68-pounders&mdash;were
valuable auxiliaries to the batteries of our line-of-battle
ships. The carronade was essentially a British gun, and its
efficiency was never more conspicuous than in the fight
between H.M.S. <i>Glatton</i>, a converted East Indiaman, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
French squadron of four frigates and two corvettes, which
took place off the coast of Flanders on 15th July, 1796.</p>

THE MAIN GUN DECK ON H.M.S. <i>VICTORY</i><br />

<p>Typical of a ship's battery in the palmiest days of our Wooden Walls. The thick rope &quot;breechings&quot;, the blocks and tackles for running the guns
in or out, and securing them for sea, are clearly shown. So also are the &quot;trucks&quot; or wheels, and the &quot;quoins&quot; or wedges for elevating or
depressing the guns. Overhead are suspended the Sponge, Rammer, and Worm, for each gun. The latter is the implement with a double
corkscrew for withdrawing a cartridge.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The British ship, whose armament consisted of a main
battery of 68-pounder carronades, with 32-pounders on her
upper deck&mdash;fifty guns in all&mdash;completely defeated and drove
off her six assailants, who retreated to Flushing with their
decks ripped up, besides other terrible damages, one of them
being so badly mauled that she sank on arrival in port. Had
not the <i>Glatton</i> been a very slow sailer she could have
destroyed the lot. As it was, she effected her victory with
only two casualties&mdash;Captain Strangeways of the Marines
mortally, and a private marine slightly wounded.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to note the armament carried by
Nelson's <i>Victory</i> at the Battle of Trafalgar, in order that it
may be compared with that of some earlier ships of which
particulars have been given and with those of our modern
battleships, which will be found in a later chapter.</p>

<p>On that memorable day the famous old three-decker which
still swings at her buoy in Portsmouth harbour mounted&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
On her lower deck, thirty 32-pounders;<br />
On her middle deck, thirty 24-pounders;<br />
On her main deck, thirty-two 12-pounders;<br />
On her upper deck, eight 12-pounders, and four 32-pounder carronades.<br />
</div>

<p>The upper-deck 12-pounders were 2 feet shorter than
those on the main deck, and only weighed 21 cwt., as against
their 34, but the 32-pounder carronades only weighed 17
cwt. This will give an idea of the comparative lightness
of these weapons. The guns at this period, and indeed since
Elizabethan times, were mounted on carriages formed of two
wooden sides or cheeks strongly connected together by timber
cross-pieces or "transoms", and placed on four solid wooden
wheels or "trucks". They were secured to the ship's side
by thick ropes or "breechings" passing round the breech of
the gun, and long enough to allow of a certain recoil on being
fired. The gun was run out again by blocks and tackles,
which could also be used to haul it inboard without its being
fired, in order to secure it for sea and close the port. It was
trained from side to side by means of hand-spikes or levers
placed under the rear of the carriage, and elevated in a similar
manner, the hand-spikes being used to raise or lower the
breech of the gun, while the "quoin", or wedge, supporting
it was being adjusted. Similar carriages remained in use
in our navy far into the 'eighties of last century, being
used for the "converted 64-pounder", which was the old
smooth-bore 68-pounder lined with a rifled steel tube. I have
drilled at such guns myself. It was fine exercise, and it was
necessary to be pretty smart and have all one's wits about
one to get outside the breeching, if a loading number, before
the gun was run out. The 13·5-inch gun of to-day is, thanks
to hydraulics, manipulated with a tithe of the exertion required
to serve a truck gun. Here are the orders for "Exercise
at the Great Guns" which obtained in 1781, and are
considerably simpler than those previously in vogue:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">1. "Silence."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">2. "Cast loose your guns."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">3. "Level your guns."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">4. "Take out your tompions."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">5. "Run out your guns."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">6. "Prime."</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">9. "Sponge your guns."</span><br />
10. "Load with cartridge."<br />
11. "Shot your guns."<br />
12. "Put in your tompions."<br />
13. "House your guns."<br />
14. "Secure your guns."<br />
</div>

<p>"Tompions" are a species of plug used to close the muzzle
of a gun when not in action. In the "days of wood and
hemp" they were usually painted red, but in modern guns
they are generally faced with gun-metal, decorated in some
cases with the badge of the ship. "Prime" means to place
loose powder in the pan after having pierced the cartridge
with a "priming wire" thrust through the touch-hole or vent.
To "house" was to haul the gun inboard ready for securing.</p>

<p>The smooth-bore gun remained the naval weapon right up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a><br /><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to the Crimean War, though explosive shells gradually began
to be used as well as the old solid round shot. The rifling of
muskets and cannon had often been suggested by inventors
as far back as Tudor times, and occasionally a few experimental
rifled muskets were made. But in the war with
Russia, in which most of the combatants were armed with
muzzle-loading rifles, rifled cannon began to make their appearance.
The Lancaster gun, with a twisted oval bore, was
the first rifled naval gun, and was thought a great deal of
in its day. Then came the breech-loading Armstrong guns.
These were very finely turned out weapons with poly-groove
rifling, and closed at the breech by a species of block which
lifted in and out and had somewhat the appearance of a
carriage clock. It was held in position by a hollow screw
through which the charge and projectile were loaded into
the gun, and which was screwed up tight against the breech-block
before firing. This was not a very satisfactory system,
since, if not properly screwed taut, the block had a habit of
blowing out, sometimes with unfortunate results. It was
probably for this reason that none of these guns was made
bigger than a 100-pounder. The projectiles for the Armstrong
gun were covered with leaden jackets in order to take the
rifling. This jacket every now and again flew off, which
rendered these guns very unsafe to use over the heads of
our own troops.</p>

end is being passed to be thrust out of the small scuttle in the middle of the port (which is closed as soon as the gun is fired), so that the big wet end
can be placed in the gun.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The consequence was that while the Germans went in for
the Krupp breech-loading system, in which the breech is
closed by a sliding block across it, and the French for the
interrupted-screw breech-closing plug, the prototype of our
present system, we gave up breech-loaders and went in for
built-up, muzzle-loading guns. Their advocates claimed for
them simplicity, comparative cheapness, and other virtues,
but, as a matter of fact, we were entirely on "the wrong
tack" and were gradually being left behind in gun-construction
by other nations. These big muzzle-loaders were
formed by shrinking successive jackets over a steel tube
which formed the bore. They were rifled with a few wide,
shallow grooves, their projectiles being fitted with gun-metal
studs intended to travel along the rifling and so give them
the spinning movement requisite for accuracy. The biggest
guns of this class constructed in this country were the 80-ton
guns carried by the <i>Inflexible</i> at the bombardment of Alexandria,
though the Italians, who followed us in sticking to
muzzle-loaders for a time, had guns of 100 tons. Of course
the biggest guns had special hydraulic mountings, but the
broadside guns of 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-inch bore were mounted on
carriages invented by a Captain Scott. These consisted of a
pair of iron brackets, or sides, supporting the gun, which ran
in and out on slides made of iron girders that could be
trained to the right or left by means of tackles, or in most
cases by cog wheels working on curved and cogged racers.
The carriage on which the gun was mounted had rollers
beneath it with eccentric axles, so that, unless these were
raised by levers supplied for the purpose, the carriage itself
rested on the slide. This helped to check the recoil, further
restrained by a system of interlocking plates on the carriage
and slide which could be compressed together by a hand-wheel
and screw.</p>

<p>After the gun had recoiled inboard and had been reloaded,
the compressors were slackened and the gun-carriage put on
its rollers, so that it ran down the slightly-sloping slide to its
firing-position. But for all its simplicity there were very
many disadvantages attendant on the muzzle-loader. One
very important one was the impossibility of preventing the
gases caused by the explosion of the powder from escaping
past the projectile, so that part of the force of the explosion
was wasted. In breech-loading guns the projectile fits the
rifling closely&mdash;it could not be forced through the gun by
the rammer from the rear&mdash;being provided with a copper
driving-band of slightly bigger circumference than the bore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
When the gun is fired, this is driven into the grooves of the
rifling, rotates the shot, and at the same time stops any escape
of gas and consequently of energy. Thus, size for size, a
breech-loading gun must have greater range and penetration
than a muzzle-loader. A breech-loader can be made much
longer than a muzzle-loader into the bargain, as it is not
necessary to get to the muzzle to load it. This also makes
for accuracy and penetration.</p>

13.5-INCH GUNS ON H.M.S. <i>CONQUEROR</i><br />

<p>The muzzles of the monster cannon are closed by plugs or &quot;tompions&quot; with handsome designs in burnished gun-metal. Above the higher
turret is seen a &quot;Barr &amp; Stroud&quot; range-finder in a canvas case.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was a considerable time before those in this country who
had stuck to the muzzle-loading system through thick and
thin could be brought to see the error of their ways, but after
1880 breech-loaders much of the French type were introduced
into the navy, till we reached the monster 110-ton guns
carried in the <i>Benbow</i>, <i>Sanspareil</i>, and the ill-fated <i>Victoria</i>.
As I have already mentioned, the French guns were closed at
the breech by an "interrupted screw". What this is may be
shortly explained. Imagine a screw plug about one and a half
times as long as its diameter, with a close thread to it. Now,
to screw this in and out of the breech of the gun would be
a matter taking an appreciable time. Suppose, now, that we
take this screw plug and divide the outside of it&mdash;the screw
part&mdash;perpendicularly into six equal parts. Then, if we cut
away the thread of the screw on every other sixth, we shall
have three-sixths smooth and the other three-sixths with the
screw-thread still standing out upon them. If now we treat
the corresponding screw-thread in the breech of the gun itself
in a similar manner, and then insert the plug with the three
threaded portions in line with the three smooth portions cut
in the gun, we can push it directly in to its full length, after
which a sixth of a turn will lock the threaded parts together
and securely close the breech. This has proved amply strong
enough to resist the immense strain imposed by the explosion
of the charge; but while the principle has been retained in all
our cannon&mdash;except the small 3- and 6-pounder Hotchkiss
guns, which have a sliding block&mdash;it has been so improved
that the locking of the breech is still stronger, and in all but
our very big guns it can be opened and closed with just about
as much ease as a cupboard door. Of course, in monsters
like the 12-, 13·5-, and 15-inch guns, hydraulic machinery is
brought into play, by means of which their immense breech-blocks
are manipulated with the greatest ease by the movement
of various levers.</p>

<p>Machine-guns at one period were introduced into the naval
service for the special purpose of defence against torpedo-boats,
but smaller rifle-calibre weapons were also supplied for
use in the tops, boats, and in landing operations. The first-mentioned
were "Nordenfeldt" guns, firing steel projectiles of
1 inch diameter in volleys of two or five. These proved too
small to deal with the torpedo-boat, which grew bigger and
bigger and was superseded by the destroyer; and were replaced
successively by 3-, 6-, and 12-pounder rapid-fire guns. But
at the present time a 4- or 6-inch shell is required to be really
effective against the big destroyers which are now in commission.
The rifle-calibre guns were at first Gatlings with
revolving barrels, then Gardner and Nordenfeldt volley-firing
guns, and lastly the well-known Maxim. Some of these are
still carried on board ship but are not now of use in a naval
action, though they are most valuable when bluejackets and
marines are landed for shore service, and, upon occasion, in the
boats.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a><br /><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> are accustomed to think of the armour-clad war-ship as
entirely a thing of to-day, or at any rate of the last fifty or
sixty years. This is, however, not altogether correct. Armour

"cuirass" from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuir</i>, i.e. "leather". A French

<p>Protective devices of various kinds and materials have
been used for hundreds, nay thousands, of years for the
defence of ships specially designed for fighting purposes,
though never, it must be admitted, so generally and extensively
as at the present day. Raw hides were constantly
used in ancient and mediæval times to protect ships and the
wooden towers used in sieges on shore. Thick felt was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
utilized for this purpose. The Normans hung their galleys
with this material in a battle with the Saracens off Palermo
in 1071, and it played not only a defensive but a decorative
part in the equipment of the big "dromons" of the Saracens
and Byzantines, which were covered with thick woollen cloth
soaked in vinegar to render it fire-proof, and hung with
mantlets of red and yellow felt&mdash;a rather gaudier war-jacket
than the slate-grey of our "Dreadnoughts".</p>

<p>Whatever the advantages of felt, there were naval constructors
who stood fast by the old "adage", "There's nothing
like leather". Thus, at the siege of Tyre in 1171 and the
forcing of the entrance of the Nile in 1218, an extensive use
was made of a species of small craft known as "barbots" or
"duck-backs", whose crews were protected by a strong domed
deck or roof covered with leather. Again, in 1276, Pedro III
of Aragon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cuirassed</i> two of his biggest ships with leather&mdash;probably
raw hides&mdash;before sending them to engage the fleet
of Charles of Anjou. Lead was also used for ship armour in
mediæval times. It is said that the great dromon captured
by Richard I off Beyrout had some kind of leaden plating.
Later on, this heavy metal preceded copper as a sheathing for
the under-water portions of ships: the <i>Grande Françoise</i>,
launched in 1527, was lead-sheathed from her keel to the first
wale above her water-line. Three years later than this date a
regular "lead-clad" was launched at Nice, where she had been
built to the order of the Knights of Malta, who had not very
long before been driven out of Rhodes by the Turks.</p>

<p>This big vessel, the <i>Santa Anna</i>, was a regular "Dreadnought"
in her day. While as fast as other unprotected
vessels of her time, she was heavily plated with lead, fastened
to her sides with brazen bolts, from her upper deck down
to her keel; and this armour was so strengthened by the thick
backing of her timbers that, "having been many times engaged,
and received much cannonading, she was never pierced
below the bulwarks". She carried fifty heavy guns, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
numerous smaller pieces, of which not a few were carried aloft
in her many fighting-tops.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that she had a large armoury,
a chapel, forges, a bakery, and a band. "She had various
lodges and galleries round the poop, and chests and boxes full
of earth, wherein were planted cypresses and divers other
trees and flowering shrubs, after the fashion of a garden,
small but beautiful." This is about the only garden I have
ever heard of afloat, except the mythical "garden in the main-top",
where are said to be grown any vegetables, "tin-bag"
or other, which arouse the inquisitiveness of ship-visitors.
But the main-top has now gone, and I suppose the "garden"
with it.</p>

<div class="caption">The <i>Finis Belli</i>, the first regular Ironclad Ship armed with Cannon<br />

<p>The funnel on the poop is presumably the galley funnel, though placed in an
unusual position.</p></div>
</div>
<p>It has been stated, but without any authority being quoted
for the statement, that "chain-netting of iron was suspended
to the sides of men-of-war, which were also strengthened by
plates in the time of Henry VIII and Elizabeth". I should
say this is very doubtful, since Sir William Monson, in his
<cite>Naval Tracts</cite>, published at that period, does not mention
this practice, although he refers to a number of other protective
devices. But, as we have already seen, iron was used
as a protection&mdash;probably against ramming&mdash;by the Viking
ships of many centuries before this time.</p>

<p>The first regular ironclad ship armed with cannon appears
to be that quaint craft christened the <i>Finis Belli</i>, which was
constructed by the burghers of Antwerp what time they were
closely besieged by the redoubtable Alexander Farnese, Duke
of Parma, in the year 1585. With this floating battery, for
it was little else, the besieged hoped to be able to break the
Spanish blockade. There are various accounts of her. One
states that she was protected by iron plates, another that
her sides were from 5 to 10 feet thick, "filled with rotten
nets, well rammed in, which made them firm and almost
impenetrable". Probably the hull proper, which was very
low in the water, was protected in this way, and the built-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
battery or casemate, which she had amidships, was covered
more or less with iron. She mounted twenty heavy guns,
besides lighter pieces, and carried a large number of musketeers,
some in her fighting-tops, some behind a loopholed
bulwark over her battery, and others, "which could not be
hurt, being lodged lower than the cannon could batter".</p>



<p>Unfortunately for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les braves Belges</i> the <i>Finis Belli</i> was
a total failure. In spite of her three rudders she was
"very troublesome to govern", and eventually ran aground
and had to be abandoned. The Spanish besiegers laughed
prodigiously at this effort, and nicknamed the abandoned
ironclad the <i>Caramanjula</i> or "Bogey-bogey". As for her
designers, they re-named her <i>Perditæ Expensæ</i>, or "Money
thrown away".</p>

<p>With hull covered with plates of copper and iron, two rudders, one at the bow
and one at the stern; and a paddle-wheel as her propelling machinery, fitted inside.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Dutch patriots struggling for freedom from Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tyranny had tried their hands at a somewhat similar contrivance
about ten years earlier, which was known as <i>The
Ark of Delft</i>. This seems to have been a double-hulled
arrangement, with three hand-turned paddle-wheels placed
between the two hulls. The <i>Ark</i> only rose 5 feet above the
water-line, was 110 feet long and 46 feet broad. She mounted
twenty guns, and "a large gallery was suspended from her
three military masts"&mdash;whatever that may mean. It is a
curious but generally accepted fact that a great many more
or less modern "inventions" have been forestalled in the Far
East. Gunpowder was first made in China; water-tight compartments
were commonly used in the ships of that country
hundreds of years before they found a place in our men-of-war.
It is not altogether strange, therefore, that the Japanese
should have been in possession of what may well have been
a pretty formidable armour-clad so far back as the year 1600&mdash;a
remarkable-looking craft, more like a big turtle than
anything else. She was cased with hexagonal plates of iron
and copper, fitted closely together. She had a rudder at both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
bow and stern, and was propelled by a paddle-wheel amidships,
something like the <i>Ark of Delft</i>. A Captain Saris, who
made a voyage to Japan in 1613, mentions that he there saw
a junk of from 800 to 1000 tons, sheathed all over with iron.
This was probably the one just described, which, by the way,
is stated to have carried a battery of cannon.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that impenetrability
does not necessarily imply armoured protection. An earthen
rampart may well be impenetrable, as may a thick-sided
wooden ship, as was the <i>Great Michael</i> to the artillery of her
day; yet, while affording protection to those behind it, neither
the one nor the other is armoured. Between 1600 and 1800
there were many attempts at special forms of protection, from
the floating batteries employed by the English in the mismanaged
expedition to La Rochelle to the famous Spanish
floating batteries destroyed at the Siege of Gibraltar in 1781;
but iron ship-armour does not appear again till the year of
Trafalgar.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Naval Chronicle</cite> for that year we have an account
of a vessel designed by a son of the General Congreve who is
famous as being the inventor of the "Congreve rocket", once
a somewhat highly esteemed missile. The ship&mdash;it does not
appear whether it was actually built or not&mdash;was intended
for the attack of the French invasion flotillas which were
blockaded inside their ports by our fleets. It was to have
sloping sides covered with iron plates and bars, proof against
any gun of the period, and was to be armed with four big
mortars and the same number of 42-pound carronades. Her
rudder, anchors, and cables were to be entirely under water,
and so not exposed to hostile artillery, while she was to be
rigged in such a way that masts, yards, and sails could be
lowered or erected in a quarter of an hour. When these were
"struck" and housed under the armour she could be moved&mdash;probably
at a very slow pace&mdash;by oars pulled by forty men,
worked entirely under cover.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Fulton, the famous American inventor, who built a submarine
boat, and invented mines and torpedoes and other
weapons of war, turned his attention to the protection of
war-vessels. He was probably responsible for a little paddle-wheel-propelled
vessel for towing torpedoes, which is described
as being covered with ½-inch iron plates, "not to be injured
by shot". Later on he built a steam frigate, which he called
the <i>Demologos</i>, or "Voice of the People". This relied on 13-feet-thick
sides to protect her crew, but was not armour-plated.
She was blown up by accident in 1829, and replaced by the
<i>Fulton the Second</i>, which seems to have been to some extent
protected by iron armour.</p>

<p>But it was not till towards the end of the Crimean War
that real steam-propelled armour-clad ships appeared, in the
shape of a series of slow and unwieldy floating batteries,
specially designed for the attack of the massive Russian fortifications.
If anyone would like to see what these were like&mdash;that
is, as regards their hulls, for the masts have long since
disappeared&mdash;he has only to travel as far as Chatham Dockyard
and ask the policeman on duty at the main gate to direct
him to the <i>Thunderbolt</i> pier.</p>

<p>The <i>Thunderbolt</i> is one of these old ironclads which has
come down to the useful but inglorious duty of acting as
a landing-stage in the River Medway. Neither she nor any
of her English sisters was ever in action; they were too late
in the field&mdash;or rather the water. But several of the French
floating batteries, almost precisely similar vessels, took a
prominent part in the bombardment of the Russian fortress
of Kinburn, where their fire proved most effective. As for
the shot and shell from the Russian forts, they rebounded
from their sloping iron sides like so many tennis-balls. These
armoured batteries were, however, slow, clumsy, flat-bottomed
affairs, with no speed under steam or sail and but moderately
seaworthy. It remained for the French&mdash;whose models in the
"days of wood and hemp" were generally better than our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
own&mdash;to go another step forward and produce a regular sea-going
ironclad.</p>

<p>This was the famous <i>La Gloire</i>. She was no beauty. She
had an extremely ugly bow and was very short in proportion
to her beam. She was not a new ship, but the old two-decker
<i>Napoleon</i> cut down, lengthened, and covered along her whole
side with iron plating 5 inches in thickness. She took two
years to finish, and was not ready till the end of 1859. She
naturally created a good deal of excitement, and it was at
once seen that we must follow suit.</p>

<p>But our naval men did not see why they need be content
with so unsightly a war-ship. They had been much impressed,
a year or two before, by the <i>Niagara</i>, a fine United States
frigate which had visited the Thames, and which had what
was then regarded as the immense length of 337 feet. Our
constructors, therefore, were rather inclined to follow her lines
than those of <i>La Gloire</i>, and turned out the <i>Warrior</i>, a magnificent-looking
vessel, not improvised out of an old wooden
ship, but entirely built of iron. Her armour-plating, however,
did not extend from bow to stern, but only covered her battery
amidships, which occupied somewhere about two-thirds of her
total length. The <i>Warrior</i> was 382 feet long, and fitted with
a not very obtrusive ram. As a matter of fact, it was not
perceptible at all, since the stem was finished off with a very
graceful swan bow adorned with one of the finest figure-heads
ever executed. She was fully rigged, did 14½ knots
under steam at her trials, and carried an armament of thirty-eight
68-pounders, then the heaviest guns afloat. In short,
the <i>Warrior</i> was a triumph of British shipbuilding, and a
worthy ancestor of the magnificent armour-clad fleet which
has played such an important part in the history of the
nation. She had one sister, the <i>Black Prince</i>, after which
a few smaller ironclads were built, the <i>Defence</i>, <i>Resistance</i>,
<i>Hector</i>, and <i>Valiant</i>. Next came four bigger ships, the
<i>Achilles</i>, <i>Minotaur</i>, <i>Northumberland</i>, and <i>Agincourt</i>. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were all improved <i>Warriors</i>, armoured along their whole
length, with ram bows, a heavier armament, and no less than
five masts. They were imposing-looking ships, though, of
course, to-day about as obsolete as the <i>Henri Grace à Dieu</i>.</p>

<p>She was a very efficient reply to the French <i>La Gloire</i>, which was a wooden ship converted into an ironclad. Observe the Red-and-blue
Ensign. The White Ensign with St. George's Cross did not become universal in the Royal Navy till 1864.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I have a vivid recollection of a visit to the <i>Minotaur</i> when
a boy. Possibly a few extracts from notes made at the time
may be of interest. "She has five masts and is a tremendous
length. Her upper deck is furnished with a good many small
guns for repelling boat attacks. Round the masts are placed
some of the shot and shell for the large guns below, painted
white, and the knobs (i.e. studs to fit the rifling) and points
gilded. Were here shown a Gatling gun for service on shore
or for clearing the decks of boarders, &amp;c. On going below
we saw a couple of rocket-tubes burnished like a looking-glass.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
In the steerage we saw a 7- or 9-pounder boat
gun polished beautifully (as was all the metalwork in the
ship) which had an arrangement for reducing the recoil by
a cylinder full of oil. The main-deck battery consisted of
12-ton guns, lacquered to look like jet." The carriages, I
remember, were painted white and the slides under them
scarlet, which, with their burnished gun-metal machinery,
gave them a most brilliant appearance, very different from
the slate-coloured monsters of to-day. These guns were some
which had replaced her original armament of more numerous
but lighter cannon, and in consequence every other port in
the battery was vacant. But the long line of guns presented
a most imposing appearance. "Between the guns were field-guns,
boat-guns, &amp;c. Round the hatchways were ranged shot,
shell, and canister, which also appeared in every available
corner."</p>

<p>Among other notes, too long to be transcribed, I find that
the Whitehead torpedoes in the <i>Minotaur</i> were made of
copper, a material which has long since been superseded by
steel, and that I was shown "the Rumpf coil for generating
the electric light which can be shown in three places". Compare
this very modest installation with the numbers of powerful
search-lights which a battleship carries to-day, to say
nothing of the thousands of incandescent lamps which light
her interior. The "cylinder full of oil" for checking the
recoil of a small boat-gun, which is referred to above, is noteworthy
as the prototype of the almost universal system now
in use both ashore and afloat, though in the <i>Minotaur</i> none
of the big guns were fitted with this very effective apparatus.</p>

<p>As guns grew more powerful, and, in consequence, armour
increased in thickness and weight, the amount of side protection
had perforce to be reduced, so that as time went on
the battleship's cuirass was cut down to a comparatively
narrow water-line belt, with a "box-battery" containing her
heavy guns amidships. In later types the foremost and aftermost
guns in these batteries were placed at an angle and
the port "recessed" in the ship's side, so that these guns could
fire on the broadside and nearly ahead as well. In some
ships, such as the <i>Sultan</i>, <i>Alexandra</i>&mdash;which, by the way,
was long flagship of the Mediterranean fleet and a notable
ship in her day&mdash;<i>Triumph</i>, and <i>Iron Duke</i>, the box-battery
was arranged in two tiers, one above the other. All these
were broadside ships and fully rigged. If they could not
get along very fast under sail alone, the sails, under some
circumstances, were useful in "easing the engines" and getting
a little more speed out of the ship.</p>

<p>But in any case naval officers had not then brought themselves
to accept the idea of relying on their engines alone;
they liked to have a second string to their bow. Besides,
the work and evolutions aloft were undeniably a splendid
thing for the seamen; it rendered them quick, smart, and
self-reliant, and kept them in excellent physical training.</p>

<p>The reverse side of the picture was the weight of yards,
rigging, and sails, the resistance they offered to the wind
when the ship was steaming against it, the danger in action
to those quartered on the upper deck from the fall of yards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a><br /><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
blocks, and spars from aloft, and the time taken in preparing
them for action. The top-gallant masts were sent down on
deck as well as the upper yards, the top-masts were generally
lowered till they only showed a few feet above the heads of
the lower masts, extra slings had to be put in place to secure
the lower yards, the shrouds supporting the masts on either
side had to be "snaked down", by coiling wire hawsers in
a species of zigzag from top to bottom, so that if one or more
shrouds were cut the whole would hang together, and many
other precautions taken which occupied valuable time and
were, perhaps, after all of a merely negative nature&mdash;that is
to say, the rigging was more of a danger in action than
a useful asset. The tops were the only part of it that were
of use. As in ancient days they afforded stations for archers
and stone-throwers, and later on for musketry, swivel-guns,
and grenade-throwers, so they were at this time utilized for
mounting machine-guns to fire down upon an enemy's decks.</p>

<p>For at that period "close action" was always expected.
Boarders were told off when the ship "went to quarters for
action", and boarding-pikes and cutlasses were provided for
their use, while the small upper-deck guns&mdash;usually breech-loading
Armstrongs&mdash;were mounted on carriages which enabled
them to be fired downward to repel a boat attack or
the rush of a steamboat with a spar torpedo. The ideas of an
action at sea were practically the same as those which obtained
in the days of Nelson. "Masts and yards" were the source
of yet another danger. The "smartness" of a ship was still
generally gauged by her "smartness" aloft. All evolutions
in the Navy are done "against time", and for a ship to get
her "royal yards across" some seconds before any other ship
in the squadron was a notable feat of which every soul on
board was proud to a degree. These ideas were those of the
old sailing navy, and in spite of the advent of steam, ironclads,
rifled guns, and torpedoes, the conservatism of our
great sea service rendered them still paramount, so that even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gunnery took a second place. There were regulation quantities
of ammunition to be fired&mdash;"expended" was the usual term&mdash;at
regulated periods, there were orders that torpedoes were
to be run at stated intervals, that bluejackets and marines
should be landed for drill ashore every week when in harbour.
But in most ships these things were regarded as secondary and
annoying performances, to be got over and done with as soon
as possible, if they could not be avoided altogether, so that
all hands might be set to their "games with sticks and string",
as, in course of time, irreverent observers began to call the
cherished evolutions with mast and yards, and the important
business of cleaning paintwork, burnishing "brightwork",
and generally making the ship as spick and span as possible.</p>

<p>"Spit and polish" were the idols worshipped in those days
by captains and more especially commanders, for it was almost
universally recognized that their promotion depended more on
the brilliant appearance of their ships at an inspection than
on any other earthly matter. But for all that the days of
"sticks and string" were numbered, as were those of broadside
ironclads and box batteries.</p>

<p>The prime cause of the approaching change was the appearance
of a queer-looking little craft in the Civil War in
America between 1861 and 1864. The United States Government
had a fine fleet of wooden steamships at the outbreak
of hostilities, but the naval authorities of the seceding
Southern States, having raised the <i>Merrimac</i>, a 40-gun frigate
which had been sunk at the Norfolk navy yard, cut her
down, built a battery amidships armoured with two or three
thicknesses of railway iron, and attacked the Federal fleet.
The <i>Merrimac</i> had it all her own way, rammed and sank the
frigate <i>Cumberland</i>, set the bigger <i>Congress</i> on fire and compelled
her to surrender, and withdrew with all the honours
of war. But she was yet to meet her match. John Ericsson,
a Swedish engineer, was commissioned by the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Government to construct a small ironclad of his own designing.
While the <i>Merrimac</i> was engaged in defeating the
wooden ships of the Federals in Hampton Roads, the <i>Monitor</i>,
as the new vessel was called, was on her way south from New
York. She joined the Federal fleet the very night before the
<i>Merrimac</i> made a second sortie. On this occasion, as she
came out into the Roads and opened up the fleet she intended
to attack, the <i>Merrimac</i> spotted what someone described as
looking "like a cheese-box on a raft". It was an excellent
description of the little <i>Monitor</i>, which was built with a very
low freeboard and had nothing on her deck but a cylindrical
revolving turret containing a couple of guns, no masts, and
but the merest apology for a funnel. Yet she proved one too
many for the <i>Merrimac</i> with her more numerous battery of
guns. She was unable actually to pierce her sides, as her
commander had received the most peremptory orders not to
use more than 15 pounds of powder to load his guns, but
the <i>Merrimac</i> got so "rattled" that she had to sheer off.</p>

<div class="caption">The <i>Monitor</i>, the famous little ship that revolutionized warship design<br />

<p>The upper figure is a broadside view, the lower one a transverse section amidships.
The upper portion of the hull was very like a raft, and was heavily armoured all over, as

</div>

<p>This first duel between ironclad vessels attracted an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
enormous amount of attention, as is only to be supposed.
The net result in this country was that Captain Cowper
Coles, R.N., was allowed to have a cupola- or turret-ship
built which he had designed some years before. The <i>Royal
Sovereign</i>, a wooden three-decker, was cut down to within
a few feet of the water-line, plated with 5½-inch iron, and
fitted with four turrets. The foremost one carried two guns,
the remainder one apiece. She had very light pole masts
and light, hinged iron bulwarks, which gave her 3-1/3 feet more
freeboard at sea but had to be lowered before she could fight
her guns. Captain Coles, however, had the usual hankering
after "masts and yards", and, the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> having
proved moderately successful, induced the Admiralty to build
a fully rigged turret-ship. This was the unfortunate <i>Captain</i>,
whose low freeboard, heavy turrets, superstructures,
and fully-rigged tripod masts caused her to turn turtle in
a squall off Cape Finisterre on the night of 6th September,
1870. Her inventor went down in her. Her gunner and
seventeen men were the sole survivors. One other full-rigged
turret-ship was built&mdash;the <i>Monarch</i>. As she had
a very considerable freeboard she proved a seaworthy ship,
but she was the last of her kind.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime several small coast-defence turret-vessels
had been built, such as the <i>Scorpion</i> and <i>Wyvern</i> in 1865,
the <i>Abyssinia</i>, <i>Magdala</i>, and <i>Cerberus</i> in 1870, and the
<i>Glatton</i>, <i>Gorgon</i>, <i>Cyclops</i>, and others a year or so later. They
had one or two masts, but were not rigged ships. These
little turret-ships developed into the battleships <i>Devastation</i>,
<i>Dreadnought</i>, and <i>Thunderer</i>, launched between 1873 and
1877. Each had two turrets containing a couple of heavy
guns apiece. Their hulls were heavily armoured, and they
had but one mast fitted with a military top for machine-guns.
It is from this branch of our earlier armour-clad construction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that our modern "Dreadnoughts" derive their descent rather
than from the broadside type.</p>

<p>To explain further developments it must be noted that
while in this country the success of the <i>Monitor</i> induced
us to experiment with placing guns in revolving armoured
turrets, in France the tendency was to build a fixed armoured
tower in the ship, and place the guns inside on a turntable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en barbette</i>&mdash;that is to say, so mounted that they could
fire over the top of the armour in any direction. We tried
to go one better in the <i>Temeraire</i> (1877). She was a broadside
ship, with a "box-battery" amidships, but forward and
aft two pear-shaped armoured barbettes were built into her,
the tops of which rose about 1 foot or 18 inches above her
upper deck. In each of these was placed a 25-ton gun&mdash;we
classified guns by weight in those days, and not by inches
of calibre as we do now&mdash;on a mounting, which enabled it
to sink down on being fired, and to be raised up again into
its firing-position when loaded. The <i>Temeraire</i>, it may be
said, was an experimental ship in many ways. Though heavily
rigged, she had only two masts, so was like an enormous brig.
I believe I am right in saying that her mainyard was the
longest and heaviest in the Service. At one time, too, she was
painted grey, instead of the black which was then universal,
except when ships were in hot climates, when it was generally
changed to white. Yellow funnels were regulation, as was
"mast-colour"&mdash;a sort of deep-yellow ochre with a reddish
tinge&mdash;for all masts and spars. Ships were, and had been for
very many years, painted white withinboard instead of the
old eighteenth-century red. Outboard the black sides were
finished off generally with a white water-line, and a broad
white band along the upper part of the bulwarks, known
as a "boot-top". Sometimes another white line was painted
on the black side a few inches below it.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of controversy about this time as
to the relative merits of "broadside" fire and "end-on" fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Space forbids us from entering further into this question,
but, generally speaking, if a British ship carried four guns
heavier than the rest, they were so arranged that two could
be fired ahead or astern, and all four on either broadside.
But in a French ship the four corresponding guns would be
each mounted singly in barbettes arranged diamond-fashion,
so that three could be fired either ahead, astern, or on either
broadside. A couple of armoured cruisers, the <i>Imperieuse</i>
and <i>Warspite</i>, were built, probably as an experiment, on these
lines, on the latter of which I had the honour of serving for
something like twelve months. They were originally brig-rigged,
like the <i>Temeraire</i>, but this was done away with later
and replaced by a single military mast. Personally I do not
think they were a success. The <i>Warspite</i>, at any rate, was
a very wet ship. When steaming against quite a moderate
sea the water ran all over her, into the barbettes and down
below, and she was much cramped in many ways by the
arrangement of her guns. The <i>Devastation</i> and her sisters
proved very formidable and successful ships, but with the
idea of getting a heavier fire ahead or astern a new departure
was made in the <i>Inflexible</i>&mdash;the biggest ironclad we had yet
constructed&mdash;by placing her turrets, not one forward and
the other aft on the centre line of the ship, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en echelon</i>&mdash;that
is to say, diagonally amidships. Theoretically this arrangement,
which had been copied from the big Italian ships
<i>Duilio</i> and <i>Dandolo</i>, had a good deal to recommend it, but
practically there is more to be said against it than for it.
Nevertheless, four other smaller ships were built on these
lines, the <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Agamemnon</i>&mdash;which gained notoriety as
being almost impossible to steer&mdash;and the <i>Edinburgh</i> and
<i>Colossus</i>. The last two were armed with breech-loading guns,
which were now superseding the old muzzle-loaders to which
the ordnance authorities had clung with such obstinacy long
after every other nation had consigned them to the scrap heap.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a smaller single-turret ship, the <i>Conqueror</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
had been built, an unwieldy-looking craft which went by the
name of the "half-boot" from the resemblance her general
outline had to that useful article of military equipment. But
she seems to have met with the approval of the Admiralty,
since an improved sister-ship, the <i>Hero</i>, was launched about
five years later. These ships probably suggested the very
much larger ones, <i>Victoria</i> and <i>Sans Pareil</i>, each of which,
on a displacement of 10,470 tons only, carried a couple of
111-ton guns of 16·25-inch bore in a single turret&mdash;that is
to say, as their main armament. They had also a 10-inch
gun aft, and a dozen 6-inch breech-loading guns. These
formed what is called her "secondary battery". The provision
of such batteries marks a step in the evolution of war-ship
construction which is very noteworthy. The bigger
and bigger guns carried by battleships necessitated stronger
and stronger armour. In spite of improvements in quality and
manufacture the weight of armour tended constantly to increase.
The area covered had therefore to be more and more
restricted. To carry all this weight of guns and armour comparatively
large ships were necessary, and a great part of their
sides had to go without any protection at all. Their flotation
might be preserved&mdash;against attack by gun-fire&mdash;by the combination
of armoured belt and sloping armoured decks which
had by now become almost universal. But it was obvious
that the unarmoured portions of the ship above water could
be torn to pieces by the fire of comparatively light weapons.
This led to the installation of "secondary batteries" of 4-, 5-,
and 6-inch guns, for the purpose of attacking an enemy's ship
in this way and of neutralizing his attack by keeping down
the fire of <em>his</em> secondary batteries.</p>

A MONSTER GUN WHICH IS NOW OBSOLETE<br />

<p>The 111-ton gun on the old <i>Benbow</i>, which was very slow of fire and whose life was estimated at little more than 70 rounds.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The development of torpedo-attack brought about the
Whitehead automobile torpedo, and the improvements in the
speed and construction of destroyers and torpedo-boats caused
also the introduction of "auxiliary batteries" of rapid-firing
3- and 6-pounder-shell guns. The machine-guns firing rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bullets, and, later on, small steel shot, were found to have no
"stopping-power" against torpedo-craft, and more powerful
weapons became imperative.</p>

<p>The tragic end of the <i>Victoria</i>, which cost the nation, not
only a fine ship, but the lives of the greater portion of her
crew, and that very talented naval commander, Sir George
Tryon, is a well-known tragedy of the sea, and there is little
doubt that the enormous weight forward of her huge turret
and guns, with nothing aft to counterbalance it, was one of
the causes contributing to the completeness of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>No more ships were built on such lines, but about this
period an important innovation was made by the introduction
of a class of ships in which the four heavy guns were carried
in a couple of high barbettes with sloping sides, instead of
in turrets. The whole gun was exposed, but not its mountings
or crew, since the top of the barbette was closed in by
a flat shield which revolved with the guns. These were the
<i>Collingwood</i>, <i>Camperdown</i>, <i>Howe</i>, <i>Rodney</i>, <i>Anson</i>, and <i>Benbow</i>.
The last-named had one 111-ton gun in each barbette,
instead of a pair of rather smaller cannon. Amidships, between
the barbettes, were secondary batteries of half a dozen
6-inch guns (the <i>Benbow</i> had ten). These were entirely unprotected
except from fire coming from ahead or astern, from
which they were covered by armoured bulkheads reaching
across the ship immediately behind each barbette.</p>

<p>I well recollect my first sight of these ships, which had all
been completed during four years I had been away on a distant
station, though, as a matter of fact, I had seen the <i>Rodney</i>
launched before I left England. I was on board H.M.S.
<i>Aurora</i>, a new cruiser which had been specially commissioned
for the naval man&#339;uvres. We left Plymouth and proceeded
to Spithead, where a large fleet had been assembled to do
honour to the Kaiser&mdash;with whom we were then on rather
more friendly terms than latterly, and who came over at the
head of a squadron of his war-ships. He was much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
anxious to exhibit German war-ships to the British fleet than
his naval commanders seem to have been during the Great
War. We got into Spithead about six on a morning when
there was a thick drizzle almost amounting to a fog, and as
one after another of these monsters&mdash;as we thought them
then&mdash;loomed up out of the mist and vanished astern, they
presented a most impressive picture of strength and solidity.
They really did look in the dim light like "castles afloat"!</p>

<p>But they were not by any means among our most successful
efforts. No one liked the unprotected secondary batteries,
and thought of the well-armoured <i>Devastation</i> and her sisters.
<em>They</em> had no secondary batteries&mdash;but they were so well
armoured that these were not necessary, except for purposes
of offence. This consideration doubtless led to the building
of the <i>Nile</i> and <i>Trafalgar</i>, in which the four big guns were
carried in turrets and the secondary armament in an armoured
battery amidships. They were extremely well-protected ships
and would have given a very good account of any ship of their
day. But the tendency was ever for bigger ships, which
allowed, generally speaking, for greater speed, greater radius
of action, greater seaworthiness, and afforded a steadier gun
platform.</p>

<p>This produced the "Royal Sovereign" class, of over 14,000
tons displacement, a great advance in size on any ships which
had preceded them. They created a considerable sensation at
the time of their appearance, especially the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>
herself, the first of them. My own first sight of her was
somewhere in the Irish Sea, not far from the Isle of Man.
I was serving on board H.M.S. <i>Triumph</i> in the naval man&#339;uvres
of 1892. The <i>Royal Sovereign</i> passed us just at the
time tea was going on in the wardroom, which would be
between half-past three and four, and I remember how everybody
rushed up on deck to get a look at the new marvel
in shipbuilding.</p>

<p>The <i>Royal Sovereign</i> became practically the regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
type of battleship until the advent of the "Dreadnoughts",
though of course each successive batch was an improvement
on the preceding one in speed, protection, and gun-power.
All had four heavy guns in low barbettes, covered with
armoured hoods which revolved with the guns&mdash;so they may
be said to have been a combination of turret and barbette.
The single exception was the <i>Hood</i> in the "Royal Sovereign"
batch, which carried her four heavy guns in two regular
turrets. All had secondary batteries, whose guns were distributed
in armoured casemates at considerable intervals from
each other, and all had a couple of military masts, with
one or two fighting-tops on each, armed with light rapid-fire
guns. This fine series of battleships amounted to forty in
all, and formed a homogeneous and magnificent fleet, the like
of which the world had never seen. Nearly all had a displacement
of from 14,000 to 15,000 tons, and a speed of from 17 to
18 knots. Most are still in service, and though they have been
put rather in the background by our "Dreadnoughts" and
"Super-Dreadnoughts", we may still be very proud of them.</p>

<p>There were two intermediate steps between them and the
epoch-making <i>Dreadnought</i>. The first was the creation of
the "King Edward" class of five ships, dating from 1902-3.
These were very similar to their predecessors, but had over
1000 tons more displacement, were more thoroughly armoured,
and, in addition to the four 12-inch and ten or a dozen 6-inch
guns which formed their armament, were provided with four
guns of 9·2 inches calibre, each placed singly in a turret at
the corners of the superstructure. The final type before the
<i>Dreadnought</i> made her sensational appearance was the "Lord
Nelson" class, which, however, only comprised two ships&mdash;the
<i>Lord Nelson</i> herself and the <i>Agamemnon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> They were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
little bigger than the "King Edwards", but in their case the
6-inch guns were replaced by ten guns of 9·2-inch calibre, a
most formidable secondary battery, capable of penetrating a
considerable thickness of armour. The Battle of Tsushima,
between the Japanese and Russians, led to the temporary
abandonment of the secondary battery. It was considered
that battles would in future be fought at such immense ranges
that a decision, one way or another, would be reached before
the smaller guns could be brought within effective range of
the enemy, and the events of the European War go to confirm
this theory. So it was that we once more arrived at the
"all-big-gun ship", and in the <i>Dreadnought</i>, launched in 1906,
went back to the principle followed in the armament of her
namesake of 1875, and confined her armament&mdash;except for
a few small anti-torpedo-boat guns&mdash;to cannon of the largest
size. A comparison of the two <i>Dreadnoughts</i> will form an
appropriate termination to this chapter, which has already
occupied more pages than I intended.</p>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Pitt</span>", said the famous Admiral Lord St. Vincent, in the
course of an interview with the American inventor Fulton,
"is the greatest fool that ever existed, to encourage a mode
of war which they who commanded the seas did not want,
and which, if successful, would deprive them of it." Truer
words were never spoken. Fulton had invented floating
mines or torpedoes&mdash;"infernals" as they were then called&mdash;and
even an ingenious form of submarine boat. The French,
to whom he first offered them, to their honour be it spoken,
would have nothing to do with them even though hard put
to it to hold their own against the British fleet. Admiral
Decrès reported that Fulton's inventions were "fit only for
Algerines and pirates". The Maritime Prefect at Brest refused
to allow him to attack an English frigate off the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with his submarine, "because this type of warfare carries
with it the objection that those who undertake it and those
against whom it is made will all be lost. This cannot be
called a gallant death", he said. Finally, Admiral Pléville
le Pelly, the Minister of War, stated that it appeared to him
to be "impossible to serve a Commission for Belligerency to
men who employ such a method of destroying the fleet of
an enemy".</div>

<p>It is a sad reflection that after a century of much-boasted
"advance in civilization", we none of us appear to have any
chivalric scruples of this kind. But, in spite of our tremendous
ascendancy at sea, Pitt&mdash;being a politician and not a naval
officer&mdash;was, as St. Vincent said, "fool" enough to listen to
Fulton when, repulsed from France, he took the name of
Francis and brought his schemes over to this country. Experiments
were made in the Downs, and Lieutenant Robinson
of the Royal Marines carried out a demonstration before Pitt
with some of Fulton's torpedoes, or "carcasses" as they were
called, by blowing up a brig anchored off Walmer Castle.</p>

<p>The famous Sir Sydney Smith was an aider and abettor
of Fulton, though a naval officer, but his attitude may have
been due to a desire to stand well with Mr. Pitt rather than
to a conviction that the adoption of his proposed methods
of warfare would be of real service to the navy. What
doubtless attracted both men was the hope of destroying the
French invasion flotillas at Boulogne and in the Basque Roads,
which our fleet could not get at. Attempts were made, but
ended in dismal failures. The public generally was dead
against the employment of what were regarded as dastardly
and underhand apparatus, and so were most naval officers.
An officer, in a diary made at the time, describes<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> "six copper
submarine carcasses, some to hold 540 pounds of powder and
others 405 pounds" that were sent on board his ship for the
purpose of being employed against the enemy's vessels. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
says further that "Johnstone the smuggler laid one down
near the gates of the new harbour before Flushing surrendered,
but we never heard of any damage being done
by it. As for our part we never tried them&mdash;indeed, <em>our
Admiral said it was not a fair proceeding</em>."</p>

<p>The idea of attacking an enemy under water was, however,
by no means a novel one. Attempts in this direction
have been made almost from time immemorial. Swimming
under water and diving seem to have been often resorted
to in order to cut ships' cables, and even for the purpose
of boring holes in their bottoms; but the latter would appear
to be rather an impossible performance.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The Romans are
said to have had a corps or society of divers known as
<i>Urinatores</i>. Then there are legends of diving-apparatus
employed by Alexander the Great, who himself is frequently
depicted in mediæval manuscripts being lowered to the bottom
of the sea in a glass barrel.</p>

<p>In manuscripts and woodcuts of the Middle Ages there
are to be found several pictures representing men in a species
of diver's costume, supposed to have been made of leather,
with air-tubes leading to the surface of the water, where they
are buoyed by bladders. Some, instead of tubes, are provided
with flasks of air. Personally I should doubt whether such
dresses ever had any actual existence. I fancy they are
originally derived from a species of swimming-jacket or life-belt
which is depicted in a fourteenth-century manuscript
in the Imperial Historical Museum at Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A comparison between the two sketches over page will, I
think, go far to prove me right, since the so-called "Diver's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Helmet" is taken from Vegetius' <i>De Re Militari</i>, not published
before 1511. The earliest picture of a diving-helmet of this
kind I have been able to find is in a German work published in
1500: both are therefore of a later date than the "Swimming
Jacket". This "jacket" was intended to be worn as follows:
The lower rectangular part was to be placed at the back, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
oval portion to the front of the body. When the swimmer
wished to remain at the surface he inflated his jacket by
means of the tube; when he required to dive out of sight
he would let the air out. Look at the position of the buckles
and straps in the two drawings and you will see that there
is a strong presumption that the later artist deliberately made
the alteration in order to support his bogus picture of a diving-<em>helmet</em>.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of a submarine boat occurs in "Salman<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and Morolf", a German poem of 1190. This was, of course, an
imaginary one, like the famous <i>Nautilus</i> in Jules Verne's
<cite>20,000 Leagues under the Sea;</cite> but in the days of "good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Queen Bess" one William Bourne, a naval gunner, published
a detailed description of how to make "a shippe or boate that
may goe under the water unto the bottome, and so to come
up againe at your pleasure". The "device", as he calls it, had
some quite practical points.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In the following reign a Dutchman, Corneilius Van Drebbel
by name, seems actually to have built a submarine vessel,
which is stated to have gone under water from Westminster
to Greenwich, and with which James I was so pleased that
he not only had a duplicate one built, sending it as a present
to the Tsar of Russia, but so far overcame his constitutional
timidity as to adventure his precious and royal person in a
submarine trip in the Dutchman's invention. Then followed
many suggestions for submarines, but between Van Drebbel's
boat in 1620 and Fulton's in 1800 probably not more than
half a dozen were actually constructed.</p>

<p>Van Drebbel was probably responsible for the "water
mines, water petards, forged cases to be shot with fireworks,
and <em>boates to goe under water</em>" which Buckingham took with
his fleet on the ill-managed and inglorious expedition to La
Rochelle in 1626. The water-petards or floating mines were
of a very feeble description. The following is a French contemporary
account of what they were like.</p>

<p>"The composition of these petards was of Lattin (i.e. Brass)
filled with powder, laid upon certain pieces of timber, crosse
which there was a spring, which touching any vessel would
flie off and give fire to the petards, but only one took effect,
which did no great hurt, only cast water into the ship, and
that was all, the rest being taken by the King's boats."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>About 1771 David Bushnell, a native of Maine, built a
curious little submarine not unlike a walnut in shape, if you
imagine a walnut floating with the point downwards. It
was propelled by a hand-turned screw and carried a case
of powder provided with a clockwork apparatus for exploding
it at the required moment. There was an ingenious
arrangement for screwing this mine to the bottom of a ship,
and by its means the navigator of Bushnell's submarine very
nearly succeeded in blowing up H.M.S. <i>Eagle</i> when lying
in the Hudson River in charge of a convoy of transports
bringing troops for the campaign against the revolted American
colonists. Other attempts were made by the Americans
to blow up our men-of-war in the course of the war, but
without success. In the war with the United States (1812-14)
the Americans again attacked our ships in a similar
manner. The <i>Ramillies</i> in particular seems to have been
singled out for these attempts. She was attacked both by
a submarine boat and by various explosive contrivances.
The British retaliated by embarking in her 100 American
prisoners and notifying their presence on board to the United
States Government. They also bombarded the town of Stonington
for being "conspicuous in preparing and harbouring
torpedoes".</p>

<p>Between this time and the latter portion of the century
innumerable submarine boats were designed and a considerable
number of experimental ones actually built. A few of them
promised very well, though most were failures, the principal
reason of their non-success being the want of a suitable
means of propulsion. Every conceivable method was attempted,
but it was not till the advent of the internal-combustion
engine that the submarine became a really practical
proposition. Space forbids mention of even a tithe of these inventions,
but among the most notable was that invented by the
German Bauer, between 1850 and 1860, when he made a futile
attempt to blow up a Danish man-of-war. Then there were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i>Davids</i>, used by the Confederates in the Civil War in America.
Most of these drowned their crews. One, however, succeeded
in torpedoing the Federal sloop <i>Housatonic</i>, but accompanied
her to "Davy Jones's locker". A Swede, Mr. Nordenfeldt,
built about half a dozen submarines between 1880 and 1890,
one for this country, one&mdash;his first experimental one&mdash;which
was eventually purchased by Greece, two for the Turkish
Government, and, lastly, two or three for the German Admiralty.
All of these may be regarded as experimental craft, but they
are noteworthy as being the first submarines to be equipped
with Whitehead torpedoes, and certainly marked a step forward
in the science of underwater navigation.</p>

<p>The French navy was the first to tackle the problem of
submarine navigation with any real enthusiasm. French inventors
had been responsible for a very large proportion of
the designs for submarines, which had continually increased
in numbers as the nineteenth century progressed. After extensive
experiments with the <i>Gymnote</i> (launched 1888), <i>Gustave
Zèdé</i> (1893), and <i>Morse</i> (1899), France set about the construction
of a regular submarine flotilla of considerable size, launching
nearly thirty boats between 1900 and 1903. Other Powers,
except perhaps Russia, held back from the new departure,
and it is not impossible that it would have been politic for
the British Government to have maintained that attitude, in
accordance with the views of Lord St. Vincent, and to have
announced that it would refuse to recognize the crews of submarines
as legitimate belligerents. To have done this would
not have been to enunciate any new theory, for from time
immemorial this was the attitude adopted by all navies
towards the crews of fire-ships, and that it was later on
accepted to apply to those who made use of torpedoes and
floating mines is evident by the following quotation from the
naval officer's diary which has already been referred to.</p>

<p>He states that on the occasion of the attack on the French
ships in the Basque Roads by Lord Cochrane, when <em>explosion-ships</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as well as fire-ships were used, volunteers were called
for to take them in, and "no one was compelled to go, as
the enemy by the laws of war can put anyone to death who
is taken belonging to a fire-ship". Had we refrained from
following the example of the French most probably the Germans
would have done so also, first because the French submarines
sustained many accidents and did not appear very
likely, to experts such as the German naval officers, to become
a very valuable arm; and, secondly, because in naval matters
they have always tried to follow our lead. But the newspaper
"experts" and other laymen in this country to whom the idea
of submarine navigation was most captivating as something
mysterious, new, and strange, with great potentialities, not only
for warfare but for "copy", clamoured in the Press for submarines.
The Admiralty eventually ordered four "Holland"
boats for "experimental purposes".</p>

<p>John P. Holland was an American inventor, and his first
boat, built in 1875, "was a tiny affair with just enough room
in her for one man to sit down amidships and work the pedals
that turned the propeller. It was only 16 feet long, 2 feet
deep, and 20 inches wide, and it is probably the smallest submarine
ever constructed. The 'crew' had to wear a diving-dress,
and drew air from reservoirs at either end of the vessel.
Five little torpedoes were carried, which could be put out
through the dome and fired from a distance by electricity."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Between this time and 1902 Holland was responsible for six
more submarines and the design for another which was never
built. The earlier ones were small, but the last two or three
of considerable size.</p>

<p>The <i>Holland VIII</i> deserves some description, as she may
be regarded as the prototype of the British earlier submarine
vessels from which nearly all of our larger and later types
have been evolved. "She was a porpoise-like vessel 65 feet
long, nearly 11 feet in diameter, and of 75 tons displacement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Her single propeller was driven by a gas-engine when
at the surface and by an electric motor when below, both
being placed on the same shaft and connected or disconnected
as required. She carried a torpedo-tube, a tube for throwing
aerial torpedoes, and a submarine gun, the latter being placed
aft and inclined upwards, as was the aerial torpedo-tube
forward".<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This vessel, after very considerable alterations had
been made in her, was re-named the <i>Holland IX</i> and purchased
for the United States navy.</p>

<p>Observe the <i>Victory</i> in the background. If Nelson were standing on the poop with his glass, what would he think and say of these &quot;microbes of
the sea&quot;?</p></div>
</div>

<p>The First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply to a question
asked in the House of Parliament in 1900, had replied "that
the Admiralty had <em>not</em> designed a submarine boat, and did
not propose to design one, because such a boat would be the
weapon of an inferior power". Whether he was right or
wrong, the statement was a straightforward and an understandable
one. Possibly it struck the First Lord as being too
straightforward for a politician, so he at once began to "hedge",
and qualified what he had said by adding: "But if it could be
produced as a working article, the Power which possessed such
an article would no longer be an inferior but a superior
Power". It is hard to reconcile the two statements; for if a
submarine was an unworkable proposition it would be no
good to any Power, strong or weak.</p>

<p>However, a couple of years later, as I have already mentioned,
the Admiralty determined to acquire a few submarine
boats, nominally with the view of finding out how their use by
an enemy could be rendered abortive. First one and then
four other practically similar ones, to be built on Holland's
designs, were ordered from Vickers of Barrow-in-Furness.
Their displacement&mdash;submerged&mdash;was 120 tons. It must be
remembered that a submarine's surface displacement is always
less than when she has filled her tanks to sink her deeper in
the water. They were 63 feet 4 inches long and 11 feet 9
inches wide at their greatest beam; steamed from 8 to 10
knots above and 5 to 7 knots below water, carried a crew of
seven men, and had a single torpedo-tube. Many experiments
were carried out with these little vessels, the net result being
that series after series of larger and larger submarines were
constructed, each batch an improvement on the preceding one.
Thus we had, after the first five "Hollands", the A, B, C, D,
and E classes, and are now turning out the "F" class. The
description of our latest submarines must be postponed till the
chapter dealing with the fighting-ships of to-day; but it may
be noted that up to 1914 all had been improved "Hollands".
That is to say, that while some other naval powers, notably
Germany, were building their submarines more and more on
the lines of surface vessels with flat tops or decks, we remained
faithful to the "porpoise" or "fat cigar" type, only modifying
them by increasing their size and length, and by adding to the
length of the narrow superstructure, which formed a deck and
eventually a cut-water for use at the surface, but which was
independent of the actual watertight hull or body of the vessel,
since the water was allowed free access below the platform.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is time now to give some description of the evolution
of that terrible instrument of destruction, the Submarine
Mine, under which head may be included both those that
are placed below water and those that float or drift at the
surface. The utilization of explosives for the attack of shipping
has been attempted by belligerents for centuries, but
I am not aware that they have ever been employed against
peaceful traders and fishermen before the Great War. The
Germans may attempt to excuse themselves by alleging that
some merchantmen carry guns for defence; but that has been
the universal practice for centuries, and no merchantmen were
more heavily armed than the old trading-ships of the Hansa
League. Such ships were entirely different from the privateers,
provided with Letters of Marque which entitled them
to attack and capture enemy vessels if they could. On principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a><br /><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of self-defence, merchantmen were always entitled to
beat off an attack if they could, and such action exposed other
merchantmen to no reprisals. It is only of late years, when
civilization was supposed to be so far advanced as to render
the sinking of merchantmen "on their lawful occasions" an
impossibility, that they ceased to carry guns.</p>

<p>Probably the first inventor of a floating mine&mdash;in the
shape of an explosion-ship, as distinguished from a fire-ship&mdash;was
an Italian engineer, who in contemporary accounts is
variously referred to as "Gianibelli", "Gedevilo", "Genebelli",
"Gienily", "Jenabel", and "Innibel", who, by means of a
couple of small vessels filled with powder, which was built
over with tons of bricks, gravestones, millstones, and "everything
heavy, hooked, and sharp which 'this wicked witty man
thought most damageable'", blew to absolute "smithereens"
the great bridge which the Duke of Parma had built across
the Scheldt in order to complete the blockade of Antwerp in
1585. It is rather interesting to note in passing that Gianibelli
seems to have spent some time in this country. He had
a good deal to do with the building of Tilbury Fort, and
brought forward extended proposals for the reopening of Rye
Harbour, which had become silted up. This he does not seem
to have effected satisfactorily, and payment of £821, 9<i>s.</i>,
which he demanded of the Mayor and jurats of that famous
town, was refused. He may have had something to do with
the preparation of the fire-ships sent against the Spanish
Armada in Calais Roads. At any rate the Spaniards on board
thought so, for they, considering them "to be of those kind
of dreadful Powder-Ships, which that famous Enginier Frederick
Innibel had devised not long before in the River of
Skeld", cried "the Fire Antwerp", cut their cables, and put to
sea in the confusion that proved their ruin.</p>

</div>
<p>We have already mentioned the attempts made by the
British at La Rochelle with floating mines and devices of that
kind, and, coming to the time of William III, we find "Honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Benbow" employing an explosion-ship, evidently modelled on
those of Gianibelli, against the town of St. Malo. It did a
lot of damage and unroofed a great number of houses, but
effected nothing of any military value. One Meesters, a
Dutchman, was the leading spirit in this kind of warfare.
Whether he was any connection of Van Drebbel and Dr.
Kuffler I cannot say, but he induced the Government to use
his explosion-ships, or "machines" as they were termed,
probably with the view of emulating these two nautical Guy
Fawkeses who had succeeded in getting good incomes and
considerable sums of money out of the British Government
for their ideas and inventions, although, as far as can be ascertained,
none of them had proved of the slightest value or
efficiency. Explosion-ships or machines became for a time
recognized units in the British navy, and were employed
against Dunkirk, Dieppe, and various French ports without
much effect. "At the former, the machine-ships, as they are
called, did nothing but blow up themselves, and the credit of
their inventor, as some say; but he being come hither, complains
he was not seconded with ships as he ought to have been."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Very possibly he was not, for this class of warfare did not
meet with much appreciation in the Royal Navy. On the
other hand, the naval commanders complained that Mr.
Meesters "had not his machine-ships in readiness when they
had a fair opportunity of wind and weather to attack the
forts at Dunkirk, and that he had trifled all the time and
put the Government to great expense only to enrich himself,
when the whole matter was impracticable". It is not surprising,
therefore, that we hear no more of explosion-ships
for a very long time.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The attempts made against the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
ships by the Americans, and those we ourselves carried out
with indifferent success against the French Invasion flotillas,
have been already referred to. Though this form of attack
was not again employed by the navy for many years, the
following description in Müller's <cite>Elements of the Science of
War</cite> (1811) shows that something like a floating mine was
used in armies for the destruction of bridges. It consisted of
a chest fitted with a rudder and filled
with powder, and fired by means of
two gun-locks, which were set in
action by a stick protruding from the
water and attached to their triggers.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1844 some attention was attracted
to an alleged invention of a
Captain Warner for blowing up ships.
The <i>John of Gaunt</i>, a sailing-ship,
was taken in tow by a steamer and
blown up off Brighton in the presence
of an immense crowd of spectators;
but as the inventor wanted the Admiralty
to pay him £400,000 for it
before he showed them what it was
like, his secret naturally remained a
secret. It would seem to have been
merely a mine floating just beneath the surface of the water,
with some arrangement to explode it on contact. The Crimean
War gave us some little experience of underwater mines, for
several were employed by the Russians in the Baltic and the
Black Sea. They were feeble affairs, and did no damage
worth mentioning. One was fished up and exploded on board
one of our ships, but no one was seriously hurt. Some were
made of copper, others of wood fastened together like the
staves of a barrel. But the rumour of these mines, which
were stated to contain 700 pounds of powder and to explode
either on contact or by what was then called a "galvanic current"&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
is to say, electricity&mdash;caused the allied French
and British fleets in the Baltic to exercise great care in their
movements. As at the present day, a system of trawling for
them was instituted, and no less than fifty were picked up
off Cronstadt in ten
days.</p>

<p>"The angling for
this dangerous kind of
prey was thus managed:
two boats took
between them a long
rope, which was sunk
by heavy weights to a
depth of ten or twelve
feet, and held suspended
at that depth
by empty casks as
floats; the boats then
separated as far as
the rope would allow,
and rowed onwards
at right angles to the
length of the rope; it
was a species of trawl
fishing in which the
agitation of the floats
showed that a prey
had been caught,
which prey was then
hauled up carefully."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Mines were also fished up off Kertch and other Black Sea
ports, showing that the Russians had gone in extensively for
submarine defence, and only failed in causing us serious loss
on account of the primitive character of the mines and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
precautions which we took against them. On our part we
had some idea of using a so-called submarine invented by
Mr. Scott Russell, a noted engineer; but it seems to have been
merely an elongated diving-bell which could not carry out a
satisfactory trial. Two attempts were made by Boatswain
John Shepherd, R.N., to blow up Russian ships in the harbour
of Sebastopol, but apparently without success. He went in
alone in a punt, taking with him some kind of an explosive
apparatus, and for his "bold and gallantly executed" exploits
he received the Victoria Cross.</p>

VARIOUS CHINESE FLOATING MINES USED AGAINST H.M.S. <i>ENCOUNTER</i></div>
</div>

<p>At the end of the 'fifties we were engaged in war with
China for a considerable period, and the wily Celestials tried
all sorts of dodges to blow up our ships by means of floating
mines, or "infernal machines" as they were still called. They
were ingenious apparatus, some of them. The following extracts
from a letter written by an officer on board the <i>Encounter</i>,
off Canton, give a good idea of the means employed.
Three attempts were made to blow her up.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 475px;">

<div class="caption">Chinese Floating Mine<br />

<p>One of two, tied together, with which an attempt was made to blow up
H.M.S. <i>Encounter</i>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The first was a sampan", he writes, "towed by a canoe
on 24th December, 1856, and captured close under the bow by
our second gig rowing guard. The fuse was lighted in the
bamboo tubes at the side. The second attempt was on the
morning of 5th January, 1857, about 2.30. Two rafts, moored
together, with about 20 fathom of line buoyed up, with hooks
to catch cables or anything else, and, on the wires touching
the ship's side, to break by the little lead weight the lighted
fuse on the top of the bamboo, which communicated with the
powder. These were lighted and all ready, but fortunately
observed by our guard-boat and towed clear of ship. Being
only a raft it was just awash, and in each caisson at least 17
cwt. of gunpowder in open tubs and jars. The raft itself was
made of 6-inch plank well bound together, and caulked. The
third attempt was on the morning of the 7th January, 1857,
at 4.30. A pair of vessels in the shape of a can-buoy with a
flag on the top, about 8 inches long; the fuse, with a tin box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a><br /><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
containing punk<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> over the fuse, then a cover with lighted
match on top; this had a string to it, which, when pulled,
drew out the centre partition and communicated the fire to
the punk, to allow the fellows who swam off with them towards
the ship to make their escape; but they got frightened
at some stir with the boats, and by accident one went off with
a fearful explosion on the starboard bow, about 60 yards, and
the other, being deserted, floated down on our booms. One of
the men was caught and brought on board here, and had his
brains blown out at the port gangway. The buoy-shaped
vessel was capable of holding about 10 cwt. of gunpowder."
The <i>Encounter</i> was afterwards attacked by two floating mines
coupled together by a length of rope, each containing half a
ton of powder. They were towed by a Chinaman in a small
boat, who was shot by the look-outs and the mines destroyed.
The <i>Niger</i>, however, had a small junk exploded alongside her
which had, on the top of the powder in her hold, a cargo
of the most evil-smelling filth that could be found even in a
Chinese city. No damage was done to her hull, but she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
absolutely smothered with this poisonous muck, and for years
afterwards the crew of the <i>Niger</i> was subject to the annoyance
of being reminded of this malodorous incident, for whenever
a man belonging to another ship met a <i>Niger</i>, he made a
point of holding his nose!</p>

SUBMARINE MINES USED IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR</div>
</div>

<p>It remained for the mechanical ingenuity of the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to establish the submarine mine as a recognized naval weapon.
In the long war between North and South a considerable use
was made of improvised submarine mines, principally by the
Southerners in trying to prevent the ships of the big Federal
Fleet from penetrating their estuaries and harbours. Space
forbids description in detail of these contrivances, but the
sketches on p. 185 will enable you to form some idea of
their construction. The results obtained induced the British
Admiralty to carry out a series of experiments in 1865. The
old <i>Terpsichore</i> was blown up by a "torpedo-shell" charged
with 75 pounds of powder, and very much higher powered
mines were tried in various ways. Other European nations
could not afford to overlook this form of warfare, and it was
largely owing to the use of defensive submarine mines that
the Germans kept the powerful French fleet from attacking
their coast in the war of 1870. Ten years later mines and
their appliances were part of the equipment of most large war-vessels,
which carried two kinds, one holding 250, the other
500 pounds of gun-cotton. They were perfectly safe to handle,
although fully charged, since the gun-cotton was kept wet and
could only be exploded by inserting a small canister of dry
gun-cotton as a primer. They were intended to be used for
countermining and blowing up an enemy's mine defences, or
for defending the ship at anchor. For harbour defence at
home and in our overseas dominions a special branch of the
Royal Engineers was formed, known as the Submarine Miners,
who had charge of everything connected with this part of our
national defences; but with the advent of the submarine this
duty was assumed by the Royal Navy.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">What</span> is a "Naval Brigade"? "Brigade" is a military term,
and in our service an infantry brigade now consists of four
battalions, with their head-quarters staff. Not long ago two
battalions constituted a brigade. So that we see a brigade
is the combination of a small number of complete units. In
like manner a naval brigade is either, in the case of a single
ship, a landing-force composed of her bluejackets and marines
brigaded together, or, in the case of a fleet or squadron, of its
various ships' companies. In a fleet of any size the naval
brigade available for landing&mdash;if there was no chance of an
attack by sea&mdash;might amount to two or three battalions
formed out of seamen and stokers, and one of marines. It
has frequently fallen to the lot of naval brigades to carry on
a small campaign "on their own", but very often a naval
brigade has been attached to an army on active service. A
big book might be written on the services of British naval
brigades, so that we cannot hope to do more than glance at
a very few instances of their work in "soldiering on shore".</div>

<p>"Naval Brigade", by the way, is not a very ancient term,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
though in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth
centuries we often find references to the employment of a
"regiment" or "battalion" of seamen. This may possibly
be because, although embarked as part complement of our
men-of-war, the marines, who were in those times organized
in regiments and not in one large corps, did not actually
belong to the Admiralty, but to the War Office. They were
landed together, if possible, in their own regiments, and became
for the time being a part of the army, to which, in
addition, a battalion of seamen&mdash;which, it is rather confusing
to find, is sometimes referred to as a "marine regiment"&mdash;might
often be attached. But seamen and marines were not
in those times generally brigaded together, as they so frequently
have been in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 393px;">

</div>

<p>Though for many a long day the sailor proper "had no use
for soldiering", which he contemned as an inferior profession
to his own, he was always a pretty useful man with the heavy
gun. Naturally, if a man can make decent shooting with a
weapon tossing about on an unstable platform, he finds it
comparatively easy to hit his target on terra firma. One of
the earliest references to the employment of seamen in operations
on shore is at the siege of Leith&mdash;then held by French
troops&mdash;in 1560. The town was beleaguered from seaward
by the English fleet under Admiral Winter, and on the shore
side by a combined English and Scots army; and in the list
of troops detailed for an assault&mdash;which unfortunately proved
unsuccessful&mdash;we find that the "Vyce-Admyralle of the Quene's
Majestye's Schippes" was to furnish 500 men.</p>

<p>Drake's men in his expeditions to the Spanish coast were
formed into regiments and fought on shore, and after the
Restoration a battalion of seamen took part in the severe
fighting with the Moors at Tangier. It does not seem quite
clear whether this included marines or not.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Anyway, it was
under the command of Admiral Herbert and had been put
through a special course of exercise "by an expert old soldier&mdash;Captain
Barclay", who, after the first engagement, was reproved
by the Admiral "for suffering too forward and furious
advancement, lest thereby they might fall into the enemy's
ambushments". Captain Barclay retorted that "he could lead
them on, but the furies could not bring them off"!</p>

<p>At the siege of Cork by the Duke of Marlborough, in 1690,
besides the two marine regiments of the Earls of Torrington
and Pembroke, a naval brigade of 600 seamen and marines<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
was landed from the fleet, with as many carpenters and
gunners as could be spared, to assist in the construction of
the siege-batteries and gun-platforms. The brigade was
under the command of the Duke of Grafton, then captain
of one of the ships, though previously in command of the
1st Foot Guards. The readiness and cheerfulness with which
both seamen and marines dragged their heavy guns into
position in the face of the enemy's opposition is specially
recorded. The capture of the "Cat", an important outwork
covering the approaches to the city, is set down to the credit
of two of the seamen. These worthies, with or without leave,
were cruising about in front of the outposts in the early
morning in the neighbourhood of the "Cat", and, seeing no
sign of life or movement, crept cautiously up to its formidable
ramparts and found that it had been deserted by the Irish
garrison. They installed themselves in possession and signalled
the state of affairs to their friends, on which 200 men
of Colonel Hale's regiment were sent to occupy it.</p>

<p>In the expedition to Flanders in 1694 it is stated that
6000 seamen were "mixed with our land forces, and each of
them on landing" was to receive "a guinea a man".<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>In the capture of Gibraltar in 1704 the seamen played
a prominent part. The marines were all landed together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a><br /><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
under the Prince of Hesse, to cut off communication with
the mainland, while the seamen, under Captains Hicks and
Jumper&mdash;Jumper's Bastion commemorates his name at the
present day&mdash;stormed its defences at the southern end. The
marine regiments played such a distinguished part in the
gallant defence against overwhelming odds which followed
that the corps bears the word "Gibraltar"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on its colours and
accoutrements to the present day; but at one part of the
siege a force of seamen and guns was landed from the fleet
and did most useful service.</p>

<p>One of them<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> has left a very interesting account of his experiences
on this occasion. "On the morning we got thither",
he says, "the Spaniards were discovered that came up the
back of the hill. Then there was a command for twenty
of our men to go ashore with fire-arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We were all in
high spirits and fit to do execution, not being at all daunted
at their numbers, for they were like swarms of bees upon
the hill and in great confusion, and we like lions in the valley
seeking whom we might devour; as our duty required. At
it we went, loading and firing as fast as we could. Our men
had a great advantage of the Spaniards in firing uphill, and
it was a very great advantage they were not obliged to
wade, for the water often overflows that part where we were
obliged to engage them. We were happy enough in missing
the tide; had it been otherwise, we had been but in a bad
situation. The Spaniards rolled pieces of rocks down the hill
and wounded a great many of our men, but our advantage
in firing was more than all they could do. When they found
they could do no good they laid down their fire-arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
stayed ashore all night, and in the morning returned to our
ship. They found the duty too hard for the soldiers, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
there were orders sent for ten men of a ship to go ashore
again.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When we went over we found that the works
were very much demolished, for there was not a gun that
we could fire one day without its being unfit for service on
the next, for the Spaniards would dismount them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
found the duty extremely hard, for what they beat down
by day we were obliged to clear away at night."</p>

<p>After a further description of their work, the writer
speaks of the Spanish bombardment and tells how he just
escaped a "Jack Johnson" of the period by throwing himself
flat on the ground. "Had I been so unwise", he says,
"as to have stood up when it fell, I should have been lifted
up on its wings. I was hardened in that employment, and
a great many of our men ran in a terrible fright, thinking
that I was blown up. They said, when they saw me, we are
glad to see you alive. I thanked them for their regard for
me, and told them I never minded a bomb at all, only to
observe its falling and step out of the way and fall with
my face to the ground.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We continued making our works
by night and in the daytime we were employed in drawing
guns from the New Mole to Wills's Battery. We had very
indifferent ground some part of the way, therefore we were
obliged to draw in gears, in the same manner as horses do.
But when we came among the rocks we were obliged to lay
deal spars, and parbuckle them up with hawsers, and by these
means we haled them up to the Battery."</p>

<p>It is in this kind of work that our seamen have ever
proved so invaluable to the sister service on shore. A military
officer, writing of the taking of Martinique in 1762,
writes: "The cannon and other warlike stores were landed
as soon as possible, and dragged by the 'Jacks' to any point
thought proper. You may fancy you know the spirit of these
fellows; but to see them in action exceeds any idea that
can be formed of them. A hundred or two of them, with
ropes and pulleys, will do more than all your dray horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in London. Let but their tackle hold and they will draw
you a cannon or mortar on its proper carriage up to any
height, though the weight be ever so great. It is droll
enough to see them tugging along with a good 24-pounder
at their heels; on they go huzzaing, hallooing, sometimes
uphill, sometimes downhill, now sticking fast in the brakes,
presently floundering in mud and mire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and as careless
of everything but the matter committed to their charge as
if death or danger had nothing to do with them. We had
a thousand of these brave fellows sent to our assistance by
the Admiral; and the service they did us, both on shore and
on the water, is incredible."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="caption">ENGLISH BLUEJACKETS AT THE DEFENCE OF ACRE<br />

<p>Seamen and marines constantly worked together on shore during numerous expeditions
in the course of the long series of wars which only terminated with the Battle of Waterloo.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Two or three years previously the seamen of the fleet had
performed a similar duty at the siege of Quebec, and it is
related that after bringing up the guns they met a battalion
of soldiers about to go into action and insisted in falling-in
alongside them, some armed with cutlasses, some with sticks,
and others with no weapons at all. General Wolfe, coming
up, thanked them for their spirit, but urged them to continue
on their way to their ships, as they were both unarmed and unacquainted
with military discipline and man&#339;uvres. He said
that it would be of more service to their country if they did so
than for them to lose their lives for no result. To this address
some of them called out: "God bless your Honour, pray let
us stay and see fair play between the English and the French".
Wolfe again urged them to go on board. Some followed his
advice, but others, as soon as his back was turned, swore that
the soldiers should not have all the fighting to themselves.
They contrived to remain with the redcoats, and whenever
one of the latter fell a seaman put on his accoutrements,
seized his musket, and charged with the battalion. Seamen
and marines constantly worked together on shore during the
numerous expeditions that were directed against the enemy's
possessions in the course of the long series of wars which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
only terminated with the Battle of Waterloo, not so very often
in regular brigades but in landing-parties from their own ships,
notably at the defence of Acre by Sir Sidney Smith, Captain
of the <i>Tigre</i>, assisted by Colonel Douglas of the Marines and
by Colonel Philpoteaux, an engineer officer and a French
Royalist refugee. A very usual operation was for one or
two of our ships to set about the capture of a number of the
enemy's merchantmen and small craft that had sought refuge
in some harbour on the Mediterranean coast. If there was
a battery defending the entrance the ship would engage it,
and after its guns were silenced, it would be stormed by the
bluejackets and marines. After this the latter would take up
a covering position while the seamen brought out the shipping.</p>

<p>We have a somewhat amusing account of a naval brigade
of seamen which was put on shore during the unfortunate
Walcheron Expedition of 1808. It was written by a soldier,
so perhaps may have been a bit overdrawn, but it must be
remembered that there was no attempt to teach seamen
infantry drill in those days, and none of them was enlisted
for longer than a ship's commission. "These extraordinary
fellows", says the writer, "delighted in hunting the 'Munseers',
as they called the French, and a more formidable pack was
never unkennelled. Armed with a long pole, a pike, a cutlass,
and a pistol, they annoyed the French skirmishers in all directions
by their irregular and unexpected attacks. They usually
went out in parties as if they were going to hunt a wild beast,
and no huntsman ever followed the chase with more delight.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They might be seen leaping the dykes by the aid of their
poles or swimming across others, like Newfoundland dogs; and
if a few French riflemen appeared in sight, they ran at them
helter-skelter, and pistol, cutlass, or pike went to work in
good earnest. The French soldiers did not at all relish such
opponents&mdash;and no wonder, for the very appearance of them
was terrific, and quite out of the usual order of things. Each
man seemed a sort of Paul Jones, tarred, belted, and cutlassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as they were. Had we had occasion to storm Flushing I have
no doubt they would have carried the breach themselves."</p>

<p>The writer gives a humorous description of their drill, of
which they wisely only attempted enough to assist them in
moving from place to place. "'Heads up, you beggar of a
corporal, there', a little slang-going Jack would cry out from
the rear rank, well knowing that his diminutive size prevented
his being seen by his officers. Then, perhaps, the man immediately
before the wit, in order to show his sense of decorum,
would turn round and remark: 'I say, who made you fugleman,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Master Billy? Can't you behave like a sodger afore the
commander, eh?'"</p>

<p>Drill was looked upon merely as an amusing interlude in
the serious business of war and appreciated accordingly. It
was an exhibition of the same spirit of cheerfulness which
has made us so proud of our Tommies for "sticking it out"
so heroically in the trenches. This spirit never left these
gallant seamen till the last, for the account above quoted tells
how, when one of them was brought to the ground by a bullet
which broke the bones of his leg, while pursuing some of the
enemy's riflemen, he "took off his tarpaulin hat and flung it
with all his might after them, adding a wish, 'that it was an
18-pounder for their sakes!' The poor fellow was carried off
by his comrades and taken to the hospital, where he died.
Such were the men who fought our battles."</p>

<p>At the landing in Aboukir Bay in 1801 a body of seamen
under Sir Sidney Smith were of great assistance to
our army&mdash;very badly provided with artillery with which to
reply to the numerous French field-pieces. The seamen, however,
landed some guns, dragged them to a good position
among the sand-hills, and by their fire materially contributed
to the victory which ensued. It was in the same part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
world&mdash;to be exact, on the coast of Syria&mdash;that some years
afterwards, in 1840-1, a naval brigade from the Mediterranean
fleet, under Sir Charles Napier, assisted by a reinforcement of
the Royal Marines sent out from England, carried on a campaign
against Mehemet Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, who had
revolted from the Sultan and forcibly occupied Syria. There
were Turkish troops also engaged and a small detachment
from one or two Austrian ships, but Sir Charles Napier was
in charge of the operations, and no British soldiers, other than
the few marines, took part in the campaign.</p>

<p>Sir Charles, though a sailor, always thought that he was
a soldier spoiled, and was very proud of the rank of Major-General
which had been given him by the Portuguese Government
about ten years before. He had seen a little fighting
on shore in the Peninsula, and entered into this shore-going
campaign with the greatest zest. The marines, who were
formed into two battalions, did the greater part of the fighting
on land, as the seamen were required to man the guns of their
ships, which constantly co-operated with the land forces by
bombarding the enemy's towns and positions; but the bluejackets
took part in the storming of Tortosa&mdash;where they preceded
the marines as a pioneer party to remove obstacles&mdash;the
assault of a castle near Acre, the occupation of Tyre, and the
capture of Acre and Sidon. The seamen and marines of
the fleet engaged in the Chinese war of 1840-1 also did a
considerable amount of shore work of which space precludes
any account, the operations they were engaged in being so
numerous and so scattered. But we may say that, generally
speaking, the seamen acted as gunners, while the marines
were employed as infantry.</p>

<p>Naval guns mounted in shore batteries played a most distinguished
part in the Crimean War. They were manned both
by seamen and by marines, and were employed at the bombardment
and capture of Bomarsund in the Baltic and in the
trenches before Sebastopol. At the latter place, although a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
brigade of the Royal Marines had been encamped on the
heights above Balaclava, and though they and the Royal
Marine Artillery manned the guns in the redoubts built to
secure our right flank from a Russian attack, it had not been
intended to place naval guns in the siege-batteries. But when
our siege-train found that they had all they could do to
contend with the unexpected efficiency of the Russian guns, it
was hurriedly determined to call on the navy for assistance.
Fifty heavy guns were at once landed, with 35 officers and
732 seamen under Captain Stephen Lushington. The reinforcement
was most valuable. The guns were powerful and the
seamen's fire most accurate. The brigade did "yeoman service",
and sustained by the end of the siege the loss of 7 officers and
95 men killed, and 39 officers and 432 men wounded.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous naval brigade in history is the
<i>Shannon's</i> brigade, under Captain Peel, which made such
a glorious record in the strenuous days of the Indian Mutiny.
Although nearly all accounts would lead the reader to believe
that it was entirely composed of seamen, it consisted, in point
of fact, of 450 seamen, 140 marines, and 15 marine artillerymen,
drawn from both the <i>Shannon</i> and the <i>Pearl</i>. The guns
which they took with them and which did such invaluable
service were twelve in number&mdash;ten 8-inch guns&mdash;pretty
heavy pieces to haul along&mdash;and a couple of brass field-pieces.
The brigade participated in the action at Kajwa, 1st November,
1857, when Peel took charge of the operations on the death of
Colonel Powell of the 53rd, and brought them to a victorious conclusion.
On the 13th of the same month eight heavy guns and
250 of the brigade, with Peel himself, arrived before Lucknow,
where they formed part of the army under Sir Colin Campbell
which had advanced to the relief of the Europeans besieged in
the Residency. After the capture of the Sikander Bagh, the
relieving-force was checked in a narrow way by the desperate
resistance offered by the garrison of the Shah Najif, "which
was wreathed in volumes of smoke from the burning buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in front but sparkled all over with the bright flash of small-arms".<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The guns could make little or no impression on it;
retreat was impossible along the narrow crowded lane by
which the advance had been made. Desperate measures were
necessary. Peel was equal to the occasion. While his marines
and the Highlanders did their best to keep down the fire from
the rebel loopholes, his seamen man-handled two of their big
guns to within a few feet of the walls. But they had to be
drawn off again under cover of the fire from a couple of rocket
tubes, which were brought into action for the purpose. Still
their gunners had made a small breach, which they had not
even noticed themselves, and by this breach fifty men of the
93rd Highlanders, under Colonel Adrian Hope and Sergeant
Paton&mdash;who received the V.C. for this service&mdash;later on effected
an entry and expelled the garrison. The naval guns were of
the greatest service during the withdrawal of the hardly
pressed garrison of the Residency, since they kept down the
fire from the Kaisar Bagh, the principal stronghold of the
rebel sepoys. At Cawnpore and at the battle of Futtygurh,
and in the final relief of Lucknow, the <i>Shannon</i> and <i>Pearl</i>
brigades distinguished themselves time after time; but we
must leave further details, to deal with later naval brigades.</p>

<p>Passing over the operations in China in 1858-9-60, and
the attack on Simomosaki in Japan, in all of which both seamen
and marines were engaged, we come to the Ashanti War
of 1873. The opening operations were entirely carried out by
the navy, with the assistance of a few black troops. The
invading army of Ashantis was forced back over the River
Prah by the marines and seamen of the squadron, reinforced
by a small force of the former sent especially from England,
Cape Coast Castle and Elmina were saved, and time was gained
for the arrival of the expeditionary force from England under
Sir Garnet Wolseley. A small naval brigade of 200 seamen,
and 60 marines, with a rocket train, accompanied the army on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
its advance to Kumassi and played a conspicuous part in the
battle of Amoaful, suffering a loss of six officers and forty men
wounded.</p>

<p>A little naval brigade of 3 officers and 121 men with two
rocket-tubes, six 12-pounders, and a Gatling gun participated
in the fighting with the Kafirs in South Africa in 1877-8;
while in the Zulu War of a year or so later the <i>Shah</i>, <i>Active</i>,
<i>Boadicea</i>, and <i>Tenedos</i> landed a brigade of seamen and
marines of the strength of 41 officers and 812 men, with
several guns. It was employed in somewhat scattered detachments.
In 1881 a small naval brigade took part in the
inglorious Boer War and suffered heavily at the unfortunate
battle on Majuba Hill, where it lost more than half its
strength. It is to one of the seamen present that the following
terse summary of that disastrous day is attributed. "We
took three mortal hours to get up that bloomin' hill," he said,
"but we come down in three bloomin' strides."</p>

<p>The navy and marines played a considerable part in the
shore operations which followed on the bombardment of
Alexandria in 1882. After the fire of Sir "Breach'em" Seymour's
fleet had driven Arabi and his soldiers out of the city,
the mob gave itself up to murder, looting, and incendiarism.
No troops had yet arrived, and the only thing to do was to
land the naval brigade to keep order and save the city and its
European inhabitants. The bluejackets, with their Gatling
guns, supported by the marines with their rifles, lost no time
in clearing the streets of the murderous rabble. The work
was done in a thorough and effective manner, and as soon
as possible a rough-and-ready tribunal was established to
deal with special cases. In addition to these duties the naval
brigade had to find detachments to hold a line of outposts
round the landward side of the city, ready to check a very
probable attempt of Arabi to recapture the city. In a day or
so the hardly-worked seamen and marines were strengthened
by the arrival of a battalion of the Royal Marines which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
been specially sent out from England in the <i>Tamar</i> in view
of possible hostilities. It could easily have arrived at Alexandria
two or three days earlier but for a series of orders
and counter-orders from home which delayed it at Gibraltar,
Malta, and finally sent it out of the way to Cyprus, where
it was greeted with news of the bombardment, and the <i>Tamar</i>
steamed straight out of Limasol harbour without letting go her
anchor. When the army began to arrive, the naval brigade
was gradually withdrawn on board its ships, but shortly
afterwards was employed in seizing Port Said, Ismailia, and
other points on the canal.</p>

<p>In the advance along the Sweet-water Canal, which
culminated in the victory of Tel-el-Kebir, only a very small
naval contingent from the ships took part, but a battalion
of the Royal Marine Light Infantry and another of Royal
Marine Artillery were attached to the army, the latter being
told off as a body-guard to Lord Wolseley. But we must
not omit to mention Lieutenant Rawson of the Royal Navy,
to whom was committed the important task of guiding the
night march of the army against the Egyptian lines of Tel-el-Kebir
by the aid of the stars, and who fell in the moment
of victory. "No man more gallant fell on that occasion,"
reported Lord Wolseley.</p>

<p>Naval brigades were well to the fore in the fighting
which took place in the Sudan in 1884-5. At the Battle
of El Teb 13 naval officers and 150 seamen, with six machine-guns,
were present, as well as a battalion of 400 marines. It
was in this action that Captain A. K. Wilson&mdash;now Admiral
of the Fleet, Sir A. K. Wilson, V.C., G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O.&mdash;gained
the V.C. for the gallant way in which he, single-handed,
engaged no less than six of the enemy who had
endeavoured to capture one of his machine-guns. The naval
brigade suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Tamaii,
which took place not long afterwards. In the Gordon Relief
Expedition the naval brigade was naturally of great use on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the Nile, and a small detachment of fifty-eight seamen under
Lord Charles Beresford accompanied the Camel Corps in its
dash across the desert and took part in the fiercely-contested
fights of Abu Klea and Abu Kru. The marines formed the
fourth company of the Guards Camel Corps on this occasion.
In the operations on the upper Nile which preceded the fall
of Khartoum there were a few naval and one marine officer
in command of the Egyptian gunboats, whose fire proved
such a useful auxiliary to the advance of the Anglo-Egyptian
Army, while about a dozen non-commissioned officers of the
Royal Marine Artillery were responsible for the instruction
of their Egyptian gunners and the direction of their fire.</p>

<span class="caption">THE NAVAL BRIGADE IN THE BATTLE OF EL-TEB</span>
</div>

<p>Naval brigades were very much in evidence in the South
African War. No special squadron and no battalions of
marines were sent out, because it was necessary to keep our
main fleet and its personnel ready to hand in case of complications
with European powers. The big cruisers <i>Terrible</i>
and <i>Powerful</i>, however, appeared on the scene, and their
crews assisted in the formation of the naval brigades. In
October, 1899, one of these was formed at Simonstown from
the <i>Doris</i>, <i>Terrible</i>, <i>Powerful</i>, and <i>Monarch</i>.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that for the first time on record both
seamen and marines were provided with khaki uniform in
place of their usual blue-serge service-dress. This brigade
was sent to Stormberg, on to Queenstown, and then, to its
intense disappointment, back to Simonstown by sea from
East London. That is, with the exception of the <i>Terribles</i>,
who sailed for Durban. However, the very day the brigade
arrived at Simonstown it was ordered off again to join
Lord Methuen's force on the Modder River. The khaki-clad
bluejackets, with their straw hats covered with the same
coloured material, were rather a puzzle to the soldiers. During
one of the engagements which took place, some of the Scots
Guards, passing them standing by their guns, said to each
other: "Blimy, Tommy, there's them Boer guns we've took!"</p>

<p>At the Battle of Graspan the naval brigade particularly
distinguished itself. Captain Protheroe was in command,
Commander Ethelston commanding the seamen, and Major
Plumbe the marines. In the course of the action Captain
Protheroe was wounded and both the other officers mentioned
were killed, the brigade being brought out of action by Captain
Marchant of the Royal Marines.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The Boers were strongly
posted on a pair of kopjes. The eastern kopje was attacked
by a force distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Firing Line.</i>&mdash;One company bluejackets, 50 strong; three
companies Royal Marines, 190 strong in all; one company
King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.</p>

<p><i>Supports.</i>&mdash;Seven companies King's Own Yorkshire Light
Infantry.</p>

<p><i>Reserve.</i>&mdash;Half a battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment.</p>

<p>The remainder of the seamen belonging to the naval
brigade&mdash;about 150 in number&mdash;helped to cover the attack
by bringing their guns into action at about 2800 yards range.
The kopje was taken, but a heavy price was paid by the
naval brigade. There were 2 naval and 2 marine officers
killed and one of each wounded, 2 seamen and 6 marines
killed, and 13 seamen and 82 marines wounded. During the
farther advance on our western flank the guns of the naval
brigade were constantly in action. One of the big 4·7 guns,
mounted on the travelling carriage suggested by Captain
(now Admiral) Sir Percy Scott of the <i>Terrible</i>, and put into
practical form by one of her engineer officers, arrived in time
for the naval brigade to use it at Magersfontein with considerable
effect. At Paardeberg they had four of these weapons in
action, besides smaller guns. Manned either by bluejackets or
marines, and hauled along either by teams of oxen or by the
men of the brigade themselves, they again and again proved
most effective during the operations which followed.</p>

<div class="caption"><div class='attrib'>Photo. Cribb, Southsea</div>

OUR SEAMEN GUNNERS WITH A MAXIM</div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Powerfuls</i> had formed a naval brigade of
their own, and in response to the appeal made by Sir George
White, the defender of Ladysmith, for more guns, Captain
the Hon. Hedworth Lambton of that ship rushed up 17
officers and 267 men with two 4·7 guns, four 12-pounders,
and four Maxims, just managing to get into the beleaguered
town in time. On the very first day the 12-pounders managed
to put the Boer "Long Tom", which was lobbing its big projectiles
into the place, out of action, and their presence undoubtedly
saved the situation. Another naval brigade formed
part of the relieving force and fought at Colenso. This force
comprised 20 officers and 403 bluejackets and marines, to whom
must be added 2 officers and 50 men belonging to the Natal
Naval Volunteers. A formidable battery of one 6-inch, five
4·7-inch, and eighteen long 12-pounders accompanied this brigade,
which was of the greatest possible assistance to the army.</p>

<p>About this time the Boxer outbreak in China led to the
formation of other naval brigades. Though hardly to be
termed a naval brigade, it may be noted that the British
portion of the small international force which so stoutly defended
the Pekin Legations consisted of 79 Royal Marines
and 3 officers, together with a leading signalman, an armourer's
mate, and a sick-berth steward. But the relief column, under
Vice-Admiral Sir E. H. Seymour, was a big naval brigade of
various nationalities, of which about half were British&mdash;62
officers, 640 seamen, and 218 marines. The British were
under the immediate command of Captain J. R. Jellicoe,
C.B., C.V.O.,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the marines being under Major J. R. Johnstone,
R.M.L.I.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> A determined attempt was made to advance along
the railway line to Pekin, but the Chinese troops, who were
exceedingly well armed, having thrown in their lot with the
Boxers, the brigade was unable to get farther than An-tung,
which was occupied by Major Johnstone with sixty men, while
preparations were made to fall back on Tien-tsin. The force
had come up in a series of trains, but, the railway having been
broken behind it in more than one place, a great part of the
return journey had to be carried out on foot. Village after
village had to be stormed, and not far from Tien-tsin the
retreating column had to pass close under the walls of the
important Chinese arsenal of Hsi-ku, which stood on the
opposite bank of the river. From this big fortified enclosure
a heavy fire was poured upon the Europeans at short range.
It was a regular death-trap. However, the principal part of
the column sought what cover the rather high bank of the
river afforded, while Major Johnstone, with the British marines
and half a company of bluejackets, contrived to get across in
junks a little higher up, and, forming under cover of a small
village, fixed bayonets and stormed the enclosure in flank with
a tremendous rush, driving out the garrison before him. The
column halted for the night and for the next day or two
inside the arsenal, where it was attacked again and again
till a relief column moved out from Tien-tsin and brought
off the harassed naval brigade. In the meanwhile Admiral
Seymour's brigade were fighting fiercely in Tien-tsin itself.
The Pei-Yang Arsenal held by the Chinese had to be stormed,
the European quarter defended, and finally the high-walled
native city had to be taken by assault, an operation in which
the British seamen and marines suffered very heavily.</p>

<p>This is the last important occasion on which a naval brigade
was in action until the European War. So far no naval brigade,
in the sense of a force of bluejackets and marines disembarked
from their ships, has taken part in the fighting, except
perhaps at the Dardanelles. The Naval Division which went
to Antwerp was composed of marines and reservists from their
head-quarters and of naval reservists and volunteers, but we
have so little reliable information of what happened on that
occasion that it would be very inadvisable to attempt to give
any account of its performances at the present time.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a><br /><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>War-ships of all Sorts</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"The King's Navy exceeds all others in the World for three things, viz.: Beauty,

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> a previous chapter was set forth the story of the evolution
of our battleships, up to and including the famous <i>Dreadnought</i>
of 1907, the so-called "first all-big-gun type". As
there had been several "all-big-gun ships" among our earlier
ironclads, this description seems hardly warranted. However,
the <i>Dreadnought</i> stands pre-eminent as the first of the modern
type of battleship, though in power, speed, tonnage, and general
efficiency she has been far out-classed by the successive batches
of Super-Dreadnoughts which have followed her, which are
represented by the <i>Bellerophon</i>, <i>St. Vincent</i>, <i>Colossus</i>, <i>Orion</i>,
<i>King George V</i>, <i>Iron Duke</i>, and, last of all, the monster <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i>, or "<i>Lizzie</i>" as she is irreverently called. To describe
this latest product of the naval designer's art is the best
way of explaining what a really modern battleship is like.</div>

<p>The <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, then, is 600 feet in length&mdash;that is to
say, just 200 yards. Think of the distance you have often
seen measured off for a hundred-yards' race, multiply it by two,
and you will have some idea of what this means. Or, if you
have ever done any shooting on the range, try to remember
how far off the 200-yard target looked, and you will realize
what must be the size of a ship long enough to cover all the
ground between it and the firing-point. (The <i>Dreadnought</i>, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the way, was only 490 feet in length.) The beam of the <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i> is 92 feet&mdash;10 feet more than that of the <i>Dreadnought</i>.
You may well imagine that the tonnage, or weight
of water displaced, by a ship of these dimensions is enormous,
and so it is, being no less than 27,500 tons! So, also, is the
horse-power of her engines&mdash;58,000! But when we know that
they have to be able to drive this leviathan through the water
at a speed of 25 knots an hour, we can well understand the
necessity for powerful engines. To feed their furnaces 4000
tons of fuel are carried. It is not coal, but what is known as
"heavy oil", arrangements having been made by the Admiralty
for an immense quantity of this fuel, which is considered to
have many advantages over coal. Earlier ships carry a proportion
of both coal and oil. The engines are, of course, of the
turbine type, which has entirely superseded the old reciprocating
engines in the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>"The introduction of the turbine engine", writes a naval
officer, "has revolutionized the appearance of the engine-room.
The flashing piston-rods and revolving cranks have vanished.
All the driving-power of the ship is hidden in some mahogany-sheathed
horizontal cylinders, and there is nothing to indicate
that the engines are in movement but a small external dial
and needle no larger than a mantelpiece clock, attached to each
of the shafts, of which there are two in each engine-room."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> can hardly be called an "all-big-gun
ship", since besides the eight huge 15-inch guns which
form her principal armament she carries sixteen 6-inch quick-firing
guns, firing projectiles of 100 pounds weight, and about
a dozen little cannon specially mounted for firing up at
Zeppelins or aeroplanes. But her 15-inch guns are the biggest
and most powerful cannon now afloat. Not only do they fire
huge elongated shells of 1950 pounds weight, but their range
and accuracy is most remarkable. We have seen a little of
what they can do in the Dardanelles, when the ship, steaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
well out at sea, pitched these terrible projectiles right over
the peninsula of Gallipoli, to descend like a combination earthquake
and avalanche upon the Turkish forts in the straits.
The <i>Dreadnought</i> had 12-inch guns firing 850-pound projectiles,
but she carried ten to the four of all her predecessors.
But though the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> had to give up one turret,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
and therefore two guns, in order to make room for more
boiler-power for the production of greater speed, her broadside
totals 15,600 pounds of metal as against the 8500 of the earlier
war-ship, or the 12,500 pounds of later Super-Dreadnoughts
armed with ten 13½-inch big guns. But the ability to throw
heavier projectiles was by no means the only reason for increasing
the calibre of our big guns. The fact was that
gradual improvements in the 12-inch gun had made it so
long in proportion to its calibre that there was an imperceptible
sort of "whip" at the muzzle on discharge that was
yet quite enough to interfere with its accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> So we
brought out the 13.5-inch, a most formidable weapon, and,
later on, the 15-inch gun. With each of these the difficulty
of making sure of hitting at long range decreased, and the encounters
in the war that have taken place between our ships
and those of the Germans which have had the temerity to
put their noses outside their harbour defences have all gone
to prove the previously-advanced theory that the battles of the
immediate future will take place at immense ranges, at which
the smaller guns and torpedoes cannot be effectively used.</p>

<span class="caption">DECK OF A <i>DREADNOUGHT</i> CLEARED FOR ACTION</span>
</div>

<p>It would be superfluous to describe the general appearance
of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> in words, the photograph opposite
presenting it better than the most detailed description: but
it may be fairly said that while in picturesque beauty
modern battleships cannot compete with the masterpieces of
"the days of wood and hemp", there is yet an appearance
of power, proportion, and impressiveness about them which
forms a combination that may be almost called a beauty in
itself. In the same way we may compare the plain, severe
beauty of the Parthenon at Athens with the elaborately
carved, gilded, and painted workmanship of a Japanese temple.
Both are attractive to the eye in their own peculiar and
far differing ways. In the old wooden ships an appreciable
proportion of their cost went in decoration alone, but out
of the £2,400,000 expended on the "<i>Lizzie</i>" such expenditure
may be set down practically as <em>nil</em>. A plain slate-coloured
coat of paint, extending from truck to water-line, is all the
painter has had to do with her external appearance.</p>

<p>The turrets in which the <i>Queen Elizabeth's</i> big guns are
carried are four in number, and are placed on the centre line
of the ship&mdash;two forward and two aft. Each turret contains
a pair of guns, and the two innermost turrets are perched
up on a species of protected tower or pedestal in such a way
that they can fire directly over the foremost and aftermost
turrets. By this arrangement four guns can be discharged
dead ahead, four astern, and the whole eight on either broadside.
We have been some time evolving this arrangement of
turrets&mdash;in point of fact some foreign "Dreadnoughts" were
the first to adopt it.</p>

<p>Our original <i>Dreadnought</i> had five turrets, three on the
centre line of the ship and one on either broadside. The
same arrangement was carried out in the <i>Bellerophon</i> and
<i>St. Vincent</i> classes, which followed her, but in the <i>Colossus</i>
class, which succeeded them, the position of the five turrets
was altered. There was one right forward on the centre line
of the ship, then one on the port side, and farther aft another
on the starboard side. In fact, these two turrets were arranged
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en echelon</i>, just as they were in the earlier <i>Colossus</i>
and other ships. The fourth and fifth turrets were on the
centre line, and the fourth was able to fire over the fifth, just
as the second can fire over the first in the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>.
In the <i>Orion</i> class, which came next, the same arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as in the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was followed, but as there was an
additional turret it was placed by itself right amidships. No
change in this respect was made in the <i>King Georges</i>.</p>

<p>We must not leave our typical modern battleship without
some reference to the way in which she is protected by armour.
As in all such ships, the armour-plating is distributed (<i>a</i>)
to protect her flotation and (<i>b</i>) to protect her guns. With
the former object in view she has a broad water-line belt of
the finest and strongest 13½-inch armour procurable, which
is supplemented by an armoured deck of considerable thickness.
Each turret stands on a species of armoured tower,
going right down to the armoured deck, and is itself made
of 13½-inch armour. Her flotation is further safeguarded by
minute subdivision below the water-line.</p>

<p>"Long experience of naval war has established a belief,
shown by the practice of maritime powers to be unanimous,
that a navy should comprise three great classes of ships, these
classes admitting of much internal subdivision. In the period
of the great naval wars there were ships of the line, frigates,
and small craft. These are now represented by battleships,
cruisers, and smaller and special-service vessels. Individuals
of the first-mentioned class are intended to fight in large
groups, that is to say, in fleet actions; those of the second
class are intended for solitary service, or, at any rate, to fight
only in small groups; while those of the third are intended,
according to the subdivision to which they belong, for a
variety of special purposes." So writes Admiral Sir Cyprian
Bridge in his <cite>Art of Naval Warfare</cite>, and his definitions are
clear and compact.</p>

<p>With the battleship class we have already dealt, both as
regards its evolution and present-day pitch of perfection;
but want of space has precluded any attempt to trace the
evolution of the cruiser in the same way. It is therefore
necessary, before going on to describe the cruisers of our
modern navy, to glance, in the briefest possible manner, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
their predecessors of days gone by. Perhaps we may take
the viking <i>skuta</i>, or fast scouting vessel, as its first prototype,
scouting being one of the most important duties of a cruiser.
Possibly the galleys and balingers of mediæval times may be
regarded as the <i>skuta's</i> successors, while the low-lying <i>Tiger</i>
and other ships of her class in Tudor reigns may be considered
as the immediate precursors of the famous frigates and corvettes
which figured so largely and did such yeoman service
in our eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century maritime campaigns.
Our first frigates were the <i>Satisfaction</i>, <i>Adventure</i>,
<i>Nonsuch</i>, <i>Assurance</i>, and <i>Constant Warwick</i>, all built in the
year 1646; and from that time up to about 1870 a constant
succession of ships of this useful type were added to the navy,
the latest ones being, of course, steam frigates.</p>

<p>A frigate, according to an old work of 1771, was defined
as "a light nimble ship built for the purposes of sailing
swiftly. These vessels mount from twenty to thirty-eight
guns, and are esteemed excellent <em>cruisers</em>." The name was
derived from <i>fregata</i>, a Mediterranean vessel propelled both
by sails and by oars. It is said the British navy was the first
to adopt frigates for use in war, but the French, and afterwards
the Americans, were generally successful in building
the finest vessels of this class. These ships were full-rigged,
with three masts, and carried all their principal guns in one
battery on the main deck. The corvette may be regarded
as a smaller frigate, but was not square-rigged on her mizzen-mast,
and carried her main battery on her upper deck. This
later type of cruiser outlasted the frigate by some years, and
the last of them, such as the <i>Opal</i> and other corvettes of the
"Jewel" class, were very handsome vessels, though by no
means so formidable as the pole-rigged cruisers which took
their place.</p>

<p>The frigates in the old French War were considered "the
eyes and ears of the fleet". They sought out and reported the
enemy, they attacked his cruisers and commerce and protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
our own, and fully justified their name and the general reputation
for smartness which they were accorded. The duties of
our cruisers of to-day are of a very similar kind, although the
invention of wireless telegraphy and the aeroplane has supplemented
and to some extent superseded their scouting work.</p>

<p>As for what they have actually done, we have only to
recollect the various incidents of the Great War as regards
its aspects at sea. Acting in unison with those of France and
Japan, they have swept German commerce and German
cruisers from the face of the ocean, and so far, except for
shore bombardments and submarine attacks, have been the
only war-vessels engaged on either side. At the time of
writing no battleships have as yet been in action against one
another, for we may regard all those ships which have been
reported in action at sea as cruisers, from the big battle-cruiser
<i>Lion</i> down to the destroyers&mdash;and even, perhaps, our
submarines, which are very useful scouts.</p>

<p>Cruisers proper in our navy are now officially classed in
three main divisions&mdash;"battle-cruisers", "cruisers", and "light
cruisers", though a very short time ago they were subdivided
into "armoured cruisers", "first-class protected cruisers",
"second-class protected cruisers", "third-class protected
cruisers", "unarmoured cruisers", "lightly-armoured cruisers",
and "scouts".</p>

<p>The battle-cruiser is a hybrid and, as this war has proved,
a most useful war-vessel. She is not so heavily armed or
armoured as a battleship of equivalent age, but has much
greater speed. She is as big or bigger, and costs just about
as much. Thus the <i>Lion</i> was launched in the same year as
the battleship <i>Orion</i>&mdash;1910. Note the comparison below:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<td align="right">2,100,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus it will be seen that of these two contemporary ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the battle-cruiser is the bigger, cost £200,000 more, has two
less big guns, 2 inches less protection, but steams at least
7 knots faster than the battleship. Indeed, it is hard to say
whether she is or is not, on the whole, the more useful ship, even
as a battleship. The Admiralty and naval constructors would
seem to incline to this opinion, for, as we have seen in the
latest battleship&mdash;the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>&mdash;two guns have been
sacrificed for the sake of 4 knots more speed than the <i>Orion</i>.</p>

<p>The cruiser-battleship or battle-cruiser, then, not only has
almost precisely the same appearance as a battleship, though
probably of rather greater length, but has special battle duties
as well as cruiser duties. Thus, if working with battleships,
it is her business to pursue an enemy's battle squadron in
retreat, and, by bringing its rearmost ships to action, try to
induce their consorts to stand by them till her own slower but
more powerfully gunned consorts can come up and take a
hand. As for her cruising duties, we have had conspicuous
examples during the course of the war, both as to the right
and wrong way of such ships' employment. The unexpected
and opportune intervention of the <i>Inflexible</i> and <i>Invincible</i>
in the Falkland Islands battle, whose mere appearance convinced
von Spee that his "game was up"; and the way in which
Sir David Beatty was "on the spot" and swooped down on
the German North Sea raiders, are both excellent examples
of the way these formidable fighting-cruisers should be used.
If you want to see "how not to do it" you have only got to
consider the misuse of the <i>Goeben</i> in the Mediterranean, where,
after a useless bombardment of one or two not very important
Algerian towns, she fled for shelter to the Dardanelles, instead
of trying to break out into the Atlantic. It is claimed, of
course, that, but for her appearance at Constantinople, Turkey
would not have been drawn into the war on the side of Germany,
but it is hard to believe that the long-pursued German
intrigues in Turkey would have all gone for nothing without
the arrival of the somewhat discredited <i>Goeben</i>. Nor was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
use of battle-cruisers to bombard a few defenceless coast towns
a sound method of strategy. As it was, they were within
an ace of being lost&mdash;and for what result? Absolutely <em>nil</em>
from a military point of view. The battle-cruiser has a great
future before it, and it does not seem unlikely that, now that
the enormous advantages of high speed have been so clearly
demonstrated, it will altogether supersede the slower and
heavier armed and armoured battleship proper.</p>

<p>After battle-cruisers we come to cruisers. Our typical
modern cruisers may be taken to be represented by the
"<i>Defence</i>" and "<i>Achilles</i>" classes, the latest of which dates
from 1909. The former class have a displacement of 14,600
tons apiece, and carry four 9·2 and ten 7·5 guns. The latter
are about 1000 tons smaller, and have an armament of six
9·2 and four 7·5 guns. Both types have 6- to 8-inch armour,
and about 23 knots speed. They are exceedingly smart-looking
vessels, with their numerous turrets or gun-houses,
four funnels, and two lightly-rigged masts. They sit comparatively
low in the water, and present an appearance of
both speed and war-like efficiency.</p>

<p>The "County" class of cruisers, which immediately preceded
those just mentioned, are considerably smaller, though
to some minds but weakly gunned for their size. None of
them have heavier guns than 7·5-inch, and most only 6-inch
weapons. Neither have they a great deal of armour protection
or an extraordinary high rate of speed. As none have
been built within recent years, we may fairly assume that
they are not considered quite what we want at the present
time, though many or most of them have done excellent work
in the present war. You will remember how the <i>Kent</i> and
<i>Cornwall</i> fought at the battle off the Falklands.</p>

<p>The "Town" class, of not much more than half the size,
would appear to have superseded the "Counties", and they,
too, have been very much in evidence in the hostilities which
have been carried on afloat. The biggest of these are of 5400<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
tons displacement, and carry eight 6-inch guns, and as these
are the latest cruisers built, with the exception of the monster
battle-cruisers, it seems likely that it is not intended to have
any cruisers of intermediate size. Big sparsely-armoured
cruisers, like the unfortunate <i>Good Hope</i>, which did not steam
faster than smaller ones, and which carried but a poor armament
considering her size and cost, cannot be considered a
good investment. The "Town" class have done splendidly in
the war at sea. The <i>Birmingham</i> had the distinction of sinking
the first German submarine; the plucky little <i>Gloucester</i>
hung closely on the heels of the giant <i>Goeben</i> and her consort
the <i>Breslau</i> during their flight to Constantinople, though one
well-directed shot from the former would have put her out of
action and probably sent her to the bottom. The <i>Glasgow</i>,
<i>Carnarvon</i>, and <i>Bristol</i> were of great use in the Falklands
fight, the first-named having already fought against the
heavy batteries of the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i> off the
coast of Chile, while later on she sank the Dresden; while
the <i>Sydney</i> won undying fame by defeating and driving on
shore the notorious commerce-destroyer <i>Emden</i>.</p>

<p>Another distinctly modern type of cruiser is the "light
cruiser", a fast unprotected vessel with light guns of 4-inch
calibre, which has proved of immense value in the area of
"liveliness" in the North Sea. The <i>Amphion</i> opened the ball
by sinking the German mine-layer <i>Königin Luise</i> at the
very opening of hostilities, but was very soon after herself
blown up by a mine the latter had laid. She, like her sisters,
was almost exactly like a big destroyer in appearance. The
"Saucy" <i>Arethusa</i> has proved a worthy descendant of the
famous frigate after which she was named, and has more than
once particularly distinguished herself, notably in the fight off
Heligoland. But space forbids more than the mere mention of
the smallest class of cruiser, the "scouts", of just under 3000
tons, which are also extremely useful little vessels, since it is
necessary to give some account of destroyers and submarines.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The destroyer was originally built to "destroy" the torpedo-boat,
which, from its small size, had its limitations in anything
of a sea-way. The earliest torpedo-boats were ordinary steamboats,
such as are carried by most ships of any size, fitted
with a long spar with a tin of gun-cotton at the end of it,
which could be run out some way over the bows. The idea
was to approach an enemy's ship under cover of the darkness,
lower the outer end of the spar with its "torpedo" below the
water-line, place it in contact with the enemy's ship, and
explode the charge by means of an electric current. This seems
a crude way of going to work, but several ships have been
sunk by its means, notably the Confederate ram <i>Albemarle</i>,
which was attacked by Lieutenant Cushing of the United
States navy in this way in the course of the Civil War in
America. Special boats were then made for this purpose, but
the advent of the "Whitehead" automobile torpedo provided
them with a much more formidable weapon. Naval powers
built these "torpedo-boats" in considerable numbers, and they
were considered such a menace to bigger ships that the
destroyer, an almost exactly similar boat, but of larger size,
was designed to cope with them. In point of fact it did
destroy them, for it was found to be so much better an "all-round
craft", not only for attacking torpedo-boats, but to act
as one itself, that the smaller craft before long were entirely
superseded by the destroyers. Beginning about 1897 with
boats of about 180 tons, armed with 6-pounder guns, we have
now improved our destroyers till at the present day our latest
types are more than twice as big, and are armed with 4-inch
guns, which give them a decided advantage over less heavily-gunned
destroyers, as has been amply demonstrated in more
than one encounter with German destroyers. The destroyer is
used, generally speaking, for scouting purposes, and especially
to attack an enemy's submarines, which, if caught at the surface,
may be approached in a swift destroyer and sunk by
gun-fire before they are able to dive, or, with luck, may even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
be rammed. Destroyers, too, may be used to attack at night
as torpedo-boats, or even in the course of a naval action if
a favourable opportunity offers; it will be remembered that
the <i>Goliath</i> was torpedoed by a Turkish destroyer.</p>

<p>"Vessels of stealth", as submarines have been called, have
now taken the place of the obsolete torpedo-boat. The latter
relied on torpedoing her enemy under cover of the darkness,
but the submarine is most dangerous in day-time. At night
it is almost impossible for her to find her target or to estimate
the speed at which she is travelling if under way, without
which knowledge it is extremely difficult to arrange for a
torpedo to intercept her course unless fired at very close
quarters indeed. As the particulars of our submarines are
wisely kept secret, no more can be said about them than is
already public property.</p>

<p>The "E" class, our latest improved "Hollands", are 176
feet long, with a beam of a little over 22 feet, and have a displacement&mdash;when
submerged&mdash;of 800 tons. When at the surface
their heavy oil-engines, of something like 2000 horse-power,
enable them to travel at a speed of from 16 to 20
knots. When under water the electric engines are brought
into play, but owing to the increased friction and larger area
of the vessel to be forced through the water the speed of the
boat drops to 10 knots. Moreover, travelling at the most
economical rate of speed, not more than 140 knots can be
negotiated when submerged, while at the surface an "E"
submarine can travel for no less than 5000 miles without refilling
her oil-tanks.</p>

<p>These boats preserve the "porpoise" shape, are equipped
with wireless apparatus, and provided with panoramic periscopes
to enable them to sight their target when submerged.
There is no necessity nowadays to describe the
principle of a periscope, since little portable patterns of this
optical instrument, of various types, made for use in the
trenches, can be seen exposed for sale almost anywhere. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of course, those in use on a submarine are of a large and
highly perfected type. The conning-tower of the "E" boats
is armoured, and they carry a couple of quick-firing guns of
3 inches calibre in recesses on their decks, closed in by folding
doors. These little weapons can be quickly raised into position
by an arrangement of hydraulic machinery, and by merely
pressing a lever they sink down and are boxed in again in
a second or two.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> They are so mounted as to be able to fire
at a very high elevation, in order to defend the boat against
bomb-dropping air-ships or aeroplanes, but, of course, can be
used against surface vessels in the same way as those of the
German submarines, which have made several attempts to sink
merchantmen. As a modern Whitehead has a range of something
like 3 miles, travels at a speed of 50 miles an hour, and
carries a heavy charge of high explosive in its head, we need
not dwell on its formidable nature, which has been amply
proved in the course of the war. It has also been equally
proved that it is almost impossible for a submarine to torpedo
a fast and well-handled vessel once it has located the position
of its attacker.</p>

</div>

<p>"The modern submarine has every comfort commensurate
with the size and service of the vessel. The principal item
making for comfort is, of course, properly-prepared food.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
As time passed, electric cooking-apparatus was installed. This
was always subject to the many troubles inherent in early
electrical heating-apparatus. However, the idea was a step
in advance. To-day there is installed a well-arranged oven,
four or five independent plates for cooking meats and vegetables,
and an urn for keeping coffee constantly hot and on
tap when cruising. All of these things, though small in themselves,
make for contentment in the crew."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Whether or not
such cooking appliances are installed in our own submarines I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
am unable to say, but there is no doubt that everything necessary
for the comfort of their crews has been provided by the
Admiralty, and the boats themselves are very like the American
submarines which are referred to above.</p>

<p>"Monitors" are novel vessels in our navy, and at present we
have only three of them&mdash;the <i>Humber</i>, <i>Mersey</i>, and <i>Severn</i>&mdash;which
were originally built for Brazil, but were acquired from
their builders, Vickers, Maxim, &amp; Co., immediately on the outbreak
of war. They proved their usefulness by standing close
inshore and attacking the flank of the German advance on
Nieuport in the fighting between that place and Ostend which
took place in the autumn of 1914. Their light draught of
water&mdash;under 9 feet&mdash;enabled them to do this, and rendered
them very difficult targets for the German submarines, which,
moreover, could not operate in such shoal water.</p>

<p>The appearance of the original <i>Monitor</i> in the Civil War
in America has already been referred to. The United States
Navy had a considerable number of such vessels during and
after that campaign. Russia also purchased several of a
similar type. But for many years, if we except a few of an
improved type which were built for the United States Navy
between 1885 and 1895, they fell quite into disuse, except for
river work. The Austrians have a small flotilla of such vessels
on the Danube, and Brazil has had others for use on the
Amazon before the ones we took over were ordered. It
is, however, one would imagine, not without the bounds of
probability that there may be some return to the shallow-draught
"Monitor" type among the battleships of the future,
as being less vulnerable to torpedo attack. A battleship
design put forward some years ago by a Russian inventor,
which he claimed to be nearly torpedo-proof, certainly approximated
somewhat to a "Monitor".</p>

<p>The three "Monitors" which were added to our own
navy as described, are of only 1200 tons displacement apiece.
They are 265 feet long, with a beam of 49 feet, and have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
speed of 11½ knots only. But it is obvious that speed was
of very secondary consideration for the purposes for which
they were designed. They have thin armour-plating on their
sides, and carry two 6-inch guns in a turret at the bows. Aft
are a couple of 4·7-inch howitzers under revolving shields,
while half a dozen machine-guns are mounted on their upper
works. They are smart-looking little craft, with one funnel
and a single military mast with a search-light platform.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having described the various classes of our fighting-ships,
we may for a moment or two consider the subject of fighting
tactics afloat. In the old sailing-ship days it was the object of
the commander of a fighting-ship to get what was known as
the "weather-gage" of his opponent. Put into shore-going
English, this meant that, as far as possible, he kept his own
ship between the direction of the wind and his enemy, which
enabled him to man&#339;uvre more easily, close in upon him or
not as he considered more advantageous to himself. The
French were not so keen in seeking for the weather-gage,
since in that position it was not so easy to break off the
engagement and get away. This remark must not be necessarily
taken as imputing any want of courage to our then
gallant enemy, for whereas the Admiralty orders to our captains
were to find the enemy and "sink, burn, or destroy" him,
those given to the French naval officers impressed upon them
that it was their first duty to save their ships. The result
was that though as a general rule our sea-captains took the
weather-gage whenever they could get it, there were some
of them who, according to a pamphlet published in 1766,
were fond of "engaging to leeward", to prevent an enemy
from running away!</p>

<p>In fleet actions in Nelsonian times our object was to break
the enemy's line in one or more places, and, having effected
this, to set upon the broken portions with all the strength
available and defeat them in detail. This was the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
followed so successfully at Trafalgar. Of course the leading
ships of our two lines suffered severely from the broadsides
of the enemy as they approached him at right angles, but it
must be remembered that the range and efficiency of the guns
of those days was so limited that the leading and rear ships of
the combined French and Spanish fleets could not damage any
of our rear ships very much, nor even our leading ones. As
for our own ships, we were prepared to take this preliminary
pounding and not really to begin our offensive till we had
broken their line and got within close range of that portion of
their fleet we intended to destroy first. If, as at the Nile, the
enemy foolishly chose to await our attack at anchor, it simplified
matters for us pretty considerably. We could, as we did,
move towards one end of their line at an angle on which we
could exchange broadsides as we advanced on equal terms, and
as soon as one-half of our ships had passed the flank selected
for attack, both halves altered course so as to move parallel
to the line of anchored Frenchmen and engage half their line
with a superiority of two to one. Each French ship had to
fight two British ones, one on either side. The ships farther
down the line could do nothing to assist them unless they
weighed anchor, made sail, and broke their formation, and so
simply lay there waiting their turn to be dealt with.</p>

<p>Steam has, of course, put all this class of man&#339;uvring long
out of date, though as long as naval warfare endures on this
earth the main principle of attempting to take the enemy at
a disadvantage must always remain. In the early days of
ironclads there were various theories as to the best fighting-formations.
There were advocates of "line ahead", that is to
say, each ship following the other in "Indian file"; of "line
abreast", in which ships advanced like a line of soldiers in
"extended order", and which necessitated that each ship should
have a very powerful "right ahead" fire; and various group
formations. At the battle of Lissa, in 1866, practically the
only fleet engagement during the ironclad period prior to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Chino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, the victorious
Austrians attacked the Italian fleet in a wedge-shaped formation;
but they intended to use their rams and to fight at
absolutely close quarters, a procedure which in the present
days of long-range guns of tremendous power and extraordinary
accuracy would be almost, if not quite, impossible. The
ram, moreover, is now practically obsolete. In the naval
actions in the Far East, to which reference has been made,
the generally adopted battle-formation was that of "line
ahead", the first of those explained above, and the ideal
man&#339;uvre was considered to be what was known as "crossing
the T"&mdash;that is to say, to get one's line of ships into such
a position with regard to the enemy's line that, while his
represented the perpendicular part of the "T", one's own
would be in the place of the horizontal line forming the top of
the letter: in fact, to be in the same relative position as were
the enemy's fleet at Trafalgar to our advancing lines. With
modern guns and gunnery the whole fleet could concentrate
on and smash up the leading ships one after the other, those
following in rear not being able to do very much to assist
them. Obviously it is the object of every fleet commander to
avoid being caught in this way. If he sees the enemy's line
are steering so as to cross his course at right angles, he will
alter course to one parallel to theirs. If within range, broadsides
will doubtless be exchanged while passing, but each
opposing line will then try to turn and cross the enemy's "T"
for him by passing in rear of his line. Both will be awake to
this man&#339;uvre, so that if the man&#339;uvre continues on normal
lines the battle will resolve itself into two curved lines of ships
chasing each other round the circumference of a circle.</p>

<p>But varieties of speed, the disabling of some ships, and the
menace of destroyers or submarines will probably throw any
such regular sequence entirely out of gear, and, other things
being equal, victory will incline to the fleet whose commander
is quickest to adapt its formation to meet the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
emergencies of the fighting and to turn them to his own advantage.
But he will not be able to do this unless his fleet is
well drilled in man&#339;uvre, and at least as capable of carrying
out his orders and signals with smartness and efficiency as
that of the enemy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i282.jpg" width="500" height="327" alt="diagram " />
<div class="caption">Squadron in &quot;Line on a Bearing&quot; or &quot;Bow and Quarter Line&quot;<br />

<p>Observe the first position of the five battleships <span class='small'>A</span>, <span class='small'>B</span>, <span class='small'>C</span>, <span class='small'>D</span>, <span class='small'>E</span> (shaded). Each can fire
right ahead, right astern, and on both broadsides. They are steering due west. Now
suppose they all turn directly south. They will then be in similar formation, as indicated
by a, b, c, d, e (unshaded).</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the present time, perhaps what is known as the "line
on a bearing"&mdash;i.e. compass bearing&mdash;or "bow and quarter
line" as it is sometimes called, is the favourite formation,
and there is a very great deal to be said in its favour. It is
what is known as an "echelon" formation when applied to
the man&#339;uvres of soldiers. The word "echelon" is derived
from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">echelle</i>, a ladder, and the ships in this case
are disposed in a way suggestive of the steps of a ladder or
stair. Thus, suppose the flagship leading, the next ship would
follow her on a parallel course, not immediately in her wake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
but some way astern on her port or starboard quarter, the
next in a corresponding position with regard to the second
ship, and so on, as indicated in the annexed diagram.</p>

<p>If you look at this you will at once see its advantages over
"line ahead". Every ship can bring its broadside to bear either
to port or starboard, as in that formation, but, in addition,
every ship can fire directly ahead or astern as well. If ships
in "line ahead" all turn together to the right or left, or, to use
the correct wording, alter course together eight points to starboard
or port, only the leading and rear ship could use their
broadsides, and only one of them at that. But a similar turn
in "bow and quarter line" can be made without any loss of
fire effect.</p>

<p>In the Great War we have not, at the time of writing, yet
had a fleet action. The German Navy has shown itself most
determined&mdash;to take no risks. It seems to be imbued with
the principles impressed by the French Government on its sea
commanders in the old wars with us.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Never, on any account,
are ships to be hazarded against superior force, or, in other
words, the ships of the "admiral of the Atlantic" are not to
fight unless in very superior force to their antagonists, as was
the case in the action off Chile. The German squadron, starting
out on the second raid on our coasts, no sooner clapped
eyes on Admiral Beatty's ships&mdash;which only numbered one
more ship than the German squadron&mdash;than it turned tail and
made off for all it was worth. So the British had no chance
of crossing the "T", or of any man&#339;uvre other than a stern
chase. Such a chase is proverbially a long one, but in this
case it was long enough to enable our seamen and marines to
sink one German and badly damage at least two others, who
only got away "by the skin of their teeth", thanks to the
intervention of their mine-fields and submarines.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&mdash;<cite>H.M.S. "Pinafore".</cite> W. S. Gilbert.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of our naval story we found our fleets composed
of rowing-vessels, fought and commanded by soldiers.
Then came a time&mdash;the viking period&mdash;when fighting-ships
were manned and fought by warriors who were emphatically
"soldiers and sailors too". In battle their dragons and long-serpents
relied mainly on their oars, but the sail began to take
a much more important position than before, and the oars
were not pulled by slaves but by the crew proper, all of
whom were fighters. In the period that followed, the sail&mdash;in
northern waters at any rate&mdash;continued to grow in importance,
till in the biggest ships it entirely ousted the oars.</div>

<p>Then arose the professional sailor. Ships carried but a
few sails, so that comparatively few men were required to
handle them, and the fighting-men on board and the commanders
of ships and squadrons were once more soldiers.
When the fully rigged ship arrived&mdash;in Tudor times&mdash;the
sailor element naturally was considerably increased, and, the
heavy gun making its appearance on shipboard at about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
same time, the "gunners" seem to have been taken from that
class rather than from the soldiers, who formed about half the
ship's company. But in the royal ships the supreme command
was always in the hands of a military officer, till the
successes gained by the privately-equipped ships commanded
by men like Drake and Frobisher introduced a new type of
distinctly naval officer. But he did not supersede the military
ship-commander much before the time of William III. Up to
that time ships seem to have had sometimes a soldier, like
Blake, in command and sometimes a sailor, like Sir George
Rooke and others.</p>

<p>The latter is a good example of what may be called the
transition period, because he, like Sir Cloudesley Shovel and
many other sea-commanders, had a commission in the Duke
of York and Albany's Maritime Regiment, instituted in 1664
and generally accepted as being the ancestor of the present
corps of Royal Marines. But it seems possible that there
must have been an idea underlying the institution of this
regiment of sea-soldiers that has never been explained. The
key to it may perhaps be found in the oft-repeated reference
to marine regiments at this period as "nurseries for the fleet".
The idea did not work, as the men trained as soldiers did not
volunteer to become sailors to an appreciable extent; but in my
own opinion there was more in the idea than this. It must
be remembered that at this time there was a great controversy
as to the most suitable officers to command our war-ships.
The "gentleman captains", who were in many cases
soldiers, but often merely courtiers, clung tenaciously to their
position, and the Court influence at their back enabled them
to stand their ground. But at the same time the claims of
the real sailors&mdash;the "tarpawlins", as they were called&mdash;who
were neither soldiers nor gentlemen, were being more and
more recognized by the public, and grew stronger and stronger.
And they certainly had a very strong case. They could themselves
sail, navigate, and fight their ships, while the other class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
had to have "masters" to do everything but the fighting for
them.</p>

<p>It seems possible that the intention of those responsible
for the raising of the "Maritime Regiment", the men of which
were indifferently referred to as "marines" or as "mariners",
was not only to provide the nucleus of a disciplined personnel,
but to produce a corps of officers who, while retaining a military
status, would yet be professional seamen. It was an
experiment, but not on a sufficiently comprehensive scale, to
transform the ill-paid, ill-treated, and ill-fed seamen of the
day into a loyal, contented and disciplined body, or to supply
a sufficient number of "gentleman-tarpawlins" to command
our ships and fleets. A large number of these officers did do
so, but quite as many continued to serve as soldiers, some
afloat in command of marines, and many others in the army.</p>

<p>As time went on, things adjusted themselves, and before
the eighteenth century had progressed very far the sailor
came into his own. The "days of oak and hemp" were at
their zenith. Our men-of-war were commanded by officers
who were thorough seamen, able to handle their ships under
sail themselves, though masters who were navigation experts
still remained. Their crews were composed of two distinct
classes&mdash;seamen and marines.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The former were, as before,
still recruited for the commission only, while the latter were
enlisted for a fixed period of service.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The best seamen, nevertheless,
made a regular profession of the navy, going from one
ship to another as they were paid off and commissioned. If
they made an occasional trip to sea in a merchantman or
privateer between whiles, that by no means impaired their
professional ability, and the "prime seamen" of those days
were the finest sailors in history. Unfortunately their number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
for various reasons, was somewhat limited, and a ship's company,
especially if she or her commander bore a bad name
afloat, had to be completed by all kinds of people. Even
the marines, regularly enlisted men as they were, were by
no means always of the same calibre.</p>

<p>According to our apparently interminable national practice,
we always began our wars shorthanded in this as well
as in every other militant service, and recruits had on these
occasions to be sent on board in the rawest stages of their
training. Yet, in spite of all these drawbacks, look at the
victories our navy won in those glorious days! Good, bad,
or indifferent, sailor or marine, the men were all true Britons
when the time came to "strike home" for King and Country,
just as their gallant descendants have proved themselves in
the Great European War. As the nineteenth century progressed,
and our navy had no big wars on hand, the seaman
element by no means deteriorated. The professional sailor
was forthcoming in sufficient numbers to man our navy in
peace-time or in minor operations, and there was no necessity
to send untrained marines afloat. Steam had made its
appearance, but it was far from superseding sail-power. The
executive were still sailors, heart and soul, and had no hankering
after soldiering and drill ashore. All the same, the sailing-masters
were still retained, and seemed to be indispensable.
Admiral John Moresby, in his interesting work entitled <cite>Two
Admirals</cite>, which relates his own and his father's naval experiences
from 1786 to 1877, gives the following account of the
naval officers of 1847:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The officers, with few exceptions, were content to be
practical seamen only. They had nothing whatever to do
with the navigation of the ship or the rating of the chronometers.
That was entirely in the hands of the master, and
no other had any real experience or responsibility in the
matter. I may instance the case of a captain whose ship was
at Spithead. He was ordered by signal to go to the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of a ship on shore at the back of the Isle of Wight. In reply
he hoisted the signal of 'Inability: the master is on shore.'
'Are the other officers on board?' he was asked. He answered
'Yes,' and to the repeated order, 'Proceed immediately,' he
again hoisted 'Inability', and remained entrenched in his
determination until a pilot was sent to his assistance."</p>

<p>If a "practical seaman" was so dependent on his master
as this he would not appear to have been much of an improvement
on the soldier-captains of earlier times. It seems a most
extraordinary position, and it is almost as extraordinary that
now, when sailoring proper is a thing of the past, we may be
quite certain that no captain in His Majesty's service would
hesitate to get under way on receipt of an order to go to the
assistance of a ship in distress, whether the navigating officer
was on board or not. But, probably on account of the long
period of peace which had followed after Waterloo, neither our
navy nor army was in such a high state of efficiency as it had
been earlier in the century or is at the present minute. The
Crimean War broke like a thunder-clap on our peace-organized
forces. We know what terrible times our gallant soldiers went
through before Sebastopol on account of deficiency of commissariat,
equipment, and every other aid to efficiency which ought
to have been in readiness, but which, in fact, had no existence.
We commissioned a fine fleet for the Baltic, but it practically
effected nothing, and we had the greatest difficulty in manning
it.</p>

<p>"Public opinion", writes Admiral Moresby, "resented the
revival of the press-gang; therefore the only alternative was
the offer of a large bounty, and by this means the ships were
filled with counter-jumpers and riff-raff of all sorts, and rarely
a sailor amongst them. What this meant only those who had
to do the necessary slave-driving can tell.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In the <i>Driver</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
we may have had twenty seamen as a nucleus. The rest
were long-shore fellows, and when Admiral Berkley came on
board and told us that the Russians were at sea, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in a few days we should be in action, there was a strong dash
of anxiety in our satisfaction."</p>

<p>So short were we of men that I have been told by an officer
who served in that fleet that had it not been for the coast-guardsmen
and marines it would never have been ready for
sea. "On board the <i>St. Jean d'Acre</i>," said this officer, "we had
a splendid crew, thanks to the popularity of Harry Keppel:
the work of fitting out from a mere hulk was done by the
Royal Marines with a small number of seamen-gunners from
the <i>Excellent</i> and some boys. The officers at Portsmouth and
other places raised men <em>who would not join until the hard
work was over</em>." But good arose out of this evil, which was so
patent that it could not be overlooked by anyone. The usefulness
of the seamen-gunners and Royal Marines pointed the way
to a remedy. The marines were a permanent force; the seamen-gunners
were on the spot and under naval discipline. It
was determined to institute an equally permanent establishment
of bluejackets. The creation of this force was the most
momentous and beneficial step ever taken by the Admiralty,
and to it we owe the magnificent body of trained seamen who
have done such yeoman service to the country during the
war. Where should we have been without it? Imagine the
disasters which would have befallen us if, as at the outbreak
of the Crimean War, we had had to hunt up crews for our fleet
after the 4th of August, 1914! As it was, everything went "on
wheels", as the saying is. The Grand Fleet was ready and other
ships were put into commission without the least delay or
hitch in the smooth running of our mobilization for war. Reserves
were so plentiful that a residuum of both bluejackets
and marines was available as the nucleus of the Royal Naval
Division, which was soon recruited up to a high figure.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the end of the Crimean War
saw the beginning of our modern naval forces, with the
exception of the Royal Marines, who had been in existence as
a naval force under the Admiralty ever since 1755, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
later instituted Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Fleet Reserve,
and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. It may be noted, in
passing, that the first-mentioned reserve consists of men in
the merchant service, who, seamen by profession, receive a
training in gunnery and other matters connected with naval
warfare, and are paid an annual retaining-fee, which renders
them liable to be called up for service when required.</p>

<p>The Royal Fleet Reserve consists of both bluejackets and
marines, who, having served for twelve years on the active list,
are permitted to transfer to this force. They receive a small
daily rate of pay, and have to undergo a short revision of their
drills annually. The last-mentioned reserve has been in existence
on and off under one name or other for a considerable
number of years. In 1861 Captain Vernon of the 4th Cinque
Ports Artillery Volunteers at Hastings instituted a so-called
"marine company" in his regiment, which wore a semi-naval
uniform and was drilled at naval guns. From this small
beginning grew in time the Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers,
first formed in 1873, which assumed considerable proportions
and had branches at every important seaport. This corps
was eventually abolished because the naval authorities did
not quite see how men who in very many cases had at most
but "a bowing acquaintance" with Father Neptune could
well be utilized afloat. This decision was a great blow to
its members, who were very proud of their voluntary duties,
and after a time the Admiralty was strongly pressed by those
interested in the movement to resuscitate it. Hence the Royal
Naval Volunteer Reserve was created.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p>The bluejacket of the present day is better termed a seaman
than a sailor, since sails are non-existent in the navy
except in boats.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Besides, his official rating is seaman&mdash;ordinary
seaman, able seaman, &amp;c. Some writers in journals
dealing with naval matters have coined the, to me, objectionable-sounding
name of "fleetman". This may answer for a
comprehensive term, including seamen, marines, and stokers,
writers and other auxiliary branches of the service, but they
might all be equally well classed together as seamen or
mariners, since there is little if any difference nowadays
between the time each branch spends afloat. There are big
naval barracks now at our ports as well as marine barracks,
and bluejackets often spend there as much time as, or more
time than the marine does in his barracks.</p>

<p>The outstanding difference between the ship's company of
to-day and of past centuries is that it is composed entirely of
trained men. There are no "landsmen" and odds and ends of
humanity pitchforked on board to complete the number of the
company. Seamen, marines, and stokers all are specially
instructed in their own line of business before they appear on
board a ship in commission. The same holds good in the case
of their officers. No more boys of nineteen are appointed
captains on account of family connections; no more are officers
of marines appointed from line regiments or even from the
cavalry, as they were in days gone by. It is only fair to say
that we must go back a long way to find cases of this sort,
for as regards its officers the navy has been a permanent
profession for centuries, though its seamanhood was not in the
same position before the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>What our naval officers and men are to-day in their work
and duties is best demonstrated by a glance at the crew of a
modern man-of-war in commission. First and foremost, of
course, is the captain, not infrequently referred to by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
under his command as the "skipper", "the Old Man", or
sometimes as the "Owner". His rule may be termed a benevolent
despotism. He can no longer be the tyrant that he
occasionally was "in the days of wood and hemp", and has
no desire to be anything of the kind. He is far too much of
a gentleman and a good fellow. But there can be little limitation
to his monarchy or the machine would not work. He
lives somewhat apart from his subjects, having his meals in
lonely state, and only occasionally comes into the ward-room,
in which most of the ship's commissioned officers live and
move and have their being. The sub-lieutenant's, midshipmen's,
junior engineer officers', assistant paymasters', and
clerks' mess is known as the gun-room. In the old days what
is now the ward-room was called the gun-room, and what is
now the gun-room, the midshipmen's berth. It is probable
that this enforced seclusion is one of the worst trials of the
captain's greatness, since he has spent the whole of his previous
service afloat in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camaraderie</i> and good-fellowship of the
ward-room and gun-room. At sea he passes a great portion
of his time on the bridge, and in most ships has a special sea-cabin
in its close proximity. He is the supreme court of justice
on board, and as he can dispense punishment up to ninety
days' imprisonment with hard labour "off his own bat", it
must be a pretty bad case, or one in which an officer is concerned,
that he has to send before a court martial.</p>

<p>This should be remembered when, as is sometimes the case,
comparisons are drawn in the Press between the numbers of
courts martial in the naval and military services, or between
those held on the men of the navy and on those of the marines.
A naval court martial is a very big affair, only resorted to on
rare occasions, while in the army, besides the general court
martial, which may be ranked with the naval court, there are
district and even regimental courts martial, the latter very
small affairs, composed of three junior officers, which deal with
offences which in the navy would probably be settled off-hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
if not by the commander, at any rate by the captain. When
marines are serving ashore in their barracks they come under
army rules, so that the proportion of courts martial held on
a given number of marines must always be expected to be
greater than in the case of a similar number of bluejackets or
stokers. No comparison as to good conduct or otherwise can
therefore be instituted along these lines.</p>

<p>The captain of a ship, being in supreme command, exercises
a general supervision over his ship and all that it contains,
and is, of course, directly responsible to the admiral under
whom he is serving and to the Admiralty for its condition
both as to material and personnel. But the second in command&mdash;the
"commander"&mdash;addressed by the courtesy title of
"captain" also&mdash;may be regarded as the managing man. He
lives, or rather has his meals, in the ward-room. As to where he
actually <em>lives</em>, it may be said to be everywhere on board except
in his own cabin. He is perhaps the hardest-worked man in
the ship. Up at daylight, he is engaged in running the whole
show till he goes the rounds at 9 p.m. to see that everything
and everybody is properly settled down for the night. He
draws up a regular daily and weekly routine, which he personally
sees is regularly carried out. He "tells off" the
"hands" for this, that, and the other duties, and sees that
everyone is at his proper station at "general quarters" for
action, fire quarters, collision stations, and many another
"evolution". He holds a daily court of justice, and either
deals with the defaulters who have been "shoved in the
rattle", i.e. put in his report, himself, or in more serious cases
passes them on to the higher court&mdash;the captain. In most
ships there is yet a minor court, held by the senior officer of
marines on his own men. His powers are yet more limited, and
if after investigation he finds that they will not admit a sufficient
punishment for an offence, he takes the offender before
the commander. In some ships he is empowered by the
captain to bring such cases directly to him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the commander's hard work, he has little to
grumble at, nor, I believe, does he ever do so, except in the
ordinary conversational way we all do at times, when we
"let off steam". For he knows that, unless he is very
unfortunate in his "skipper", he has his promotion in his
own hands. He is showing what he is made of, and once
he succeeds in negotiating the big jump to captain's rank he
is assured of going right on to admiral, even if he is not fortunate
enough to "hoist his flag" in command of a squadron
or fleet. He has the relative rank of a lieutenant-colonel in
the army, and is almost invariably a much younger man,
probably from thirty to thirty-five years of age, and can take
and bear the strain of his position.</p>

<p>After the commander the lieutenants. Of these in a battleship
three or four are lieutenant-commanders, and five or six
lieutenants. The senior of these is known as the first lieutenant,
or, less officially, as "No. 1". In smaller ships they
are, of course, fewer. One of these will be the gunnery
lieutenant, another navigating lieutenant, and a third torpedo
lieutenant. The remainder are classed as watch-keepers, in
which duty they are now assisted when in harbour by the
officers of marines belonging to the ship. As everyone knows,
the day and night on board ship are divided into periods of
four hours, known as "watches", except for the "dog watches"
of two hours apiece. They run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class='unindent'>The bell is struck, generally by the marine sentry posted
nearest to it, or the corporal of the gangway, every half-hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
after reporting the time to the officer of the watch, and being
instructed to "make it so". Thus at 8.30 in the morning he
strikes it once, at 9 twice&mdash;two strokes quickly following
each other; at 9.30 three times&mdash;two quick strokes, an interval,
and a single stroke&mdash;and so on up to eight bells struck in a
succession of double strokes. There is also "little one bell",
a gentle stroke five minutes after midnight for the watch to
"fall in". The dog watches have stood from time immemorial,
in order to change the men of the night watches every
twenty-four hours. Otherwise the same men would always
be keeping the same watches. Some men would always be
on at night and others in the daytime. By dividing the
4 p.m. to 8 p.m. watches into two halves&mdash;the "first" and
"second" dog watches&mdash;the rotation is changed, so that men
come on watch at fresh periods. There is said to be a tradition
that the origin of the word "dog" is "dodge", and that
they were originally known as "dodge watches", the reason
being obvious. But I should be sorry to vouch for the
accuracy of this statement.</div>

<p>The officer of the watch is practically in command of the
ship for the time being. He has to deal with any sudden
emergency himself; there may very probably be no time to
refer to the captain, even if it is advisable to do so. He keeps
his watch on the fore-bridge, and sees that the quartermaster
at the wheel keeps the ship upon her proper course. He takes
observations from time to time, and is entirely responsible&mdash;under
the captain&mdash;for the safety of the ship and all on
board. All sorts of reports have to be made to him from
time to time, and he makes or sends any necessary reports
to the captain.</p>

<p>The lieutenants have charge of their "divisions", which
may be said to correspond to the companies of a regiment;
have to inspect them at morning and evening parades, known
respectively as "divisions" and "evening quarters", and are
responsible for their men's clothing being uniform and kept up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to the regulation quantities. They have many other incidental
duties, such as boarding ships coming into harbour as
"officer of the guard", going ashore in charge of men for
drill, musketry, and other miscellaneous work of which space
precludes the merest mention.</p>

<p>The gunnery lieutenant is, of course, responsible for the
guns and gunnery of the ship, which includes the musketry
and infantry drill of the seamen and stokers. The torpedo
lieutenant, as his name implies, has charge of the torpedoes
and their tubes and the mining gear, and it is his business to
see that they are all kept in proper working order and in
instant readiness for action. In addition, he has entire charge
of the electric lighting and wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>The navigating lieutenant has taken the place of the
old "master", but is not, as he was, outside the executive
line. His duty is to lay off the course for the ship, take
her position at various times during the day by "shooting
the sun" with his sextant, keep the chronometers wound
up, and take general charge of the navigation of the ship.
Following the order taken in the Navy List of the officers
of a ship, we come to that very important personage the
engineer commander. In some sort he occupies a similar
position to the old sailing-masters in the days when ships
were commanded by soldiers. The ship couldn't get along
without the special engineering knowledge of this officer and
his understudies any more than William the Conqueror could
have got across Channel without Stephen FitzErard, his
sailing-master.</p>

<p>We may note, in passing, that to this day the executive
ranks of the navy always call themselves the "military
branch". They are, of course, the "militant" branch, though
in one sense no one on board a ship in action can help being
a militant too.</p>

<p>The engineering branch, at any rate, stands as good a
chance of casualties as even the executive or marine portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of the ship's complement, and it is perhaps partly for this reason
that its officers have recently been allowed to wear the much-prized
executive "curl" of gold lace on their sleeves. The
engineer commander has charge of all the engines on board,
the number of which runs to several dozen, for besides the
big main engines for propelling the ship there are smaller
engines for almost every conceivable purpose. There are
engines to work the steering-gear, the winches and hoists,
the dynamos to produce electric light, for the magazine refrigerating
machinery, and many others, to say nothing of
those in the steamboats belonging to the ship. He and the
carpenter are also responsible for the hull of the ship, the
expenditure and replenishment of coal and oil, and goodness
knows how many other things! To assist him in all this
mass of work and responsibility he has two or three engineer
lieutenants and a number of artificer engineers, engine-room
artificers, mechanicians, chief stokers, and, in a big ship, hundreds
of stokers.</p>

<span class="caption">UNIFORMS OF THE ROYAL MARINES<br />

</div>

<p>The duty of senior engineer lieutenant is no sinecure
either, since he occupies much the same position in regard
to his chief as the commander does to the captain of the ship.
The remaining engineer lieutenants keep watch down in the
engine-room in the same way as the other lieutenants do
on deck.</p>

<p>Still following the order of the Navy List, we come to the
officers of marines. In the old days there were, perhaps,
five or six of these in a line-of-battleship, but the biggest
"Dreadnought" of to-day never carries more than two, unless,
perhaps, there is another one attached to the admiral's staff&mdash;supposing
it to be a flagship&mdash;for special duties in connection
with the Intelligence Department, &amp;c. Generally in a flagship
there is a major and a subaltern. Of the two, one, probably,
will be a marine artilleryman. Other big ships will
have a captain and a subaltern, and in smaller ones a captain
or subaltern alone. Their duties are considerably more
onerous than they used to be, since they are wisely made of
much more use in the general work of the ship, instead of
being relegated to the unsatisfactory rôle of being "lookers
on at life".</p>

<p>The major is, of course, responsible for the conduct, drill,
and military efficiency of his detachment, which may number
about 100 men, but he has, in addition, to inspect those of
other ships in the squadron or fleet from time to time, and
to command and drill the marines of the fleet when landed
together for drill or tactical instruction. He or the captain
of marines in another ship has charge also of the gunnery of
his men, who are told off to man some of the guns in the
ship, and may very possibly be himself stationed in one of the
control-positions in time of action. He also commands the
detachment when drawn up as a guard of honour to receive
the admiral or any distinguished visitor who is entitled to
this mark of distinction. His subaltern assists him generally
with the detachment, visits the sentries from time to time
during the night and day, keeps his turn of watch in harbour
and of officer of the guard, drills and looks after the marine
guns, and not infrequently acts as assistant gunnery or torpedo
officer. All this is very different from the old days, when the
captain or major of marines was popularly supposed to spend
his time on the stern lockers practising the flute, and when
on arrival in harbour it was considered to be a near thing
as to whether he or the "killick"<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> touched the ground first.</p>

<p>The Church takes the next place, in the shape of the
chaplain, generally a great acquisition to the mess. The
"padre" or "sky pilot" requires to be a man of considerable
tact, and generally speaking he is. He has to be on more
or less friendly terms with everyone fore and aft, or he would
find it difficult to carry out his spiritual duties effectively.
On the other hand, I may fairly say that it is his own fault
if, in this respect, he is not met more than half-way both by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a><br /><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
his messmates in the ward-room and by the "lower deck".<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
He reads prayers at divisions or morning parade, visits the
sick-bay and cells, superintends the instruction given by the
ship's schoolmaster, and, of course, carries out divine service
on Sundays. Sometimes he occupies the post of naval instructor
in addition to his strictly clerical duties, and in
that capacity instructs the midshipmen in various more or
less scientific subjects, such as applied mathematics and navigation,
&amp;c., and generally musters his pupils on deck with
their sextants at noon to take their observations and work
out the exact position of the ship. He and the paymaster
often look after the men's savings-bank, and make themselves
useful in other small matters connected with the interior
domestic economy of the ship and her ward-room mess.</p>

<div class="caption"><div class='attrib'>Photo. Cribb, Southsea</div>

THE 13.5-INCH GUN: SOME IDEA OF ITS LENGTH<br />

<p>Thirteen midshipmen seated upon this monster naval gun seem to emphasize its length. Sixteen of our super-Dreadnoughts each
carry eight or ten 13.5-inch guns. They settled the fate of the <i>Blücher</i> in the Dogger Bank fight, and sent the other German
ships back to port shattered and on fire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The fleet surgeon, with one or two surgeons, has entire
charge of the health of both officers and men. His special
domain is the "sick-bay", generally situated forward, so that
the sick get the freshest air, and he is assisted in his duties
by a staff of sick-berth stewards and sick-berth attendants.
He is an autocrat in his way, as not even the captain can
traverse his decisions as to health or disease. He makes a
daily report of the officers and men on the sick-list to the
captain, and arranges that one of his surgeons is always at
hand in case of accidents. In action he and his staff and
what extra assistants can be spared arrange a place down
below the armoured deck where they can do what is possible
for the wounded that are passed down to them. But in these
days, when guns are closed up in separate turrets and casemates,
it is not too easy a business to arrange for the transport
of these poor fellows.</p>

<p>The fleet paymaster is another non-combatant&mdash;so far as
it is possible for anyone to be so classed on a ship-of-war&mdash;and
has the responsible duty of looking after the pay,
accountant, and clerical work of the ship, stores of all kinds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and many other matters of a like nature, including "slops"
or clothes for the ship's company. The paymaster line has
no curl on the sleeve and wears white cloth between the
gold stripes of rank. The surgeons also have plain stripes,
but with scarlet cloth between them. The engineers wear
purple between their stripes, and the naval instructors sky-blue,
but this is rarely seen, since most naval instructors are
also chaplains and wear the ordinary clerical rig. Personally
I have never set eyes on the sky-blue.</p>

<p>This about finishes the list of ward-room officers, but those
in the gun-room are at least as numerous. The autocrat of
the gun-room is the senior sub-lieutenant, who is supposed
to rule his subjects with a rod of iron, or, to be more exact,
a leather dirk scabbard, which at times forms a useful and
effective instrument of justice. In the gun-room live the
midshipmen, clerks, and assistant-engineer officers, and their
duties have, generally speaking, been already indicated in
describing those of the senior officers of the various branches
to whom they are assistants and understudies. But a word
or two about the midshipmen&mdash;the "young gentlemen" as
they are generally called&mdash;will not be out of place. They
have plenty to do. They have to keep watch like their
seniors, and one important, though unofficial, part of a watch-keeping
midshipman's duties used to be to brew and bring
up a cup of cocoa to the officer on the bridge in the middle
watch. But this is probably now an exploded custom. A
midshipman generally has charge of one of the boats, and
takes great pride in keeping it and its crew well up to the
mark. The "young gentlemen" drill under the gunnery
lieutenant before breakfast, work with the chaplain or naval
instructor during the forenoon, and at any moment must be
ready to go away in charge of their boats. Every midshipman
is expected to keep a daily "log", which is periodically inspected
by the captain. Some of them take the greatest
pains not only to make their logs models of neatness, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
decorate them with sketches, drawings, and plans, often of
considerable merit and interest. This is but a very partial
and fragmentary account of the duties of the boys from
whom our future admirals and commanders-in-chief will be
recruited, but it is time this chapter was drawing to a close,
and we cannot leave our ship without at least mentioning
a few other people who, though not commissioned officers, are
yet of very great importance in her interior economy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><div class='attrib'>Photo. Cribb, Southsea</div>

6-INCH GUN DRILL: THE BREECH OPEN</div>
</div>

<p>First and foremost there are the warrant officers, pre-eminent
among whom are the boatswain, gunner, and carpenter,
three time-honoured titles. The first-named may
be regarded as the commander's right-hand man, and has
multifarious duties and responsibilities. The duties of the
other two are sufficiently indicated by their titles. Then
there are engineer warrant officers, and of late years marine
warrant officers known as "Royal Marine gunners". The
"sergeant-major" of marines, which is the courtesy title borne
by the senior non-commissioned officer of the corps on board,
is also a man of considerable importance on a man-of-war.
Then there are the chief petty officers, and petty officers such as
the yeoman of signals, the chief quartermaster, chief boatswain's
mate, and many others, together with sailmaker, blacksmiths,
armourers, electricians, coopers, cooks, bandsmen, plumbers, and
all kinds of ratings whose presence on board His Majesty's
ships and vessels of war is little suspected by the man in the
street. Then there is the ship's police, headed by the master-at-arms
or "jaundy".<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> These men are recruited from all
branches of the navy, and perform much the same duties as
the "bobby" on shore, look after the prisoners in cells, and
are supposed to detect all irregularities that may take place
on board and to bring the delinquents to justice.</p>

<p>If a ship is a flagship there is naturally a more important
personage on board than any of the officers whose ranks and
duties have been detailed&mdash;the admiral in command of the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
or squadron. He may be a full admiral&mdash;the highest rank
employed afloat&mdash;a vice-admiral, or a rear-admiral, the difference
in rank being indicated by the number of stripes on the
cuff of his coat, placed above the lower very wide stripe of
gold lace. Thus a rear-admiral has one narrow stripe above
it, with the executive curl, a vice-admiral two additional
narrow ones, and an admiral three. The admiral lives in a
regular suite of cabins, generally right aft, consisting of a
dining-room or fore-cabin, a sitting-room or after-cabin, and
two or three sleeping cabins. The captain of a flagship is
known as the flag-captain, and he, with the flag-lieutenant,
secretary, and sometimes an officer of marines, form the
admiral's staff. All these officers are distinguished from the
rest of the officers in the squadron by wearing aiguillettes.
The captain, of course, has to command his ship like other
captains, but the secretary, who is a staff-paymaster or
paymaster told off for this special duty, is the admiral's
right-hand man as regards the tremendous amount of paper
work connected with the command of a fleet or squadron.
The flag-lieutenant is the admiral's personal aide-de-camp
and so is specially to the fore, both in the big man's inspections
of ships and naval establishments and in social duties
and functions. He is also an authority in connection with
signalling in its various branches, and necessarily and generally
a smart young man all round. He and the secretary mess at
the admiral's table and not in the ward-room. A man-of-war,
it will be realized, even from this necessarily very brief
attempt to describe those who make their "home on the
rolling deep" on board her, is a little world in herself.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

28th August, 1914.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> July, 1914, it was determined to have a "test mobilization"
of the British fleet. "Mobilization" means, in connection
with either the navy or the army, the calling up of
reserves and filling up regiments or ships till they have the
numbers necessary to complete them for war service. In previous
years it was usual to have a series of naval man&#339;uvres
during the summer or autumn, to practise our fleets in working
together or to work out strategical problems. This generally
entailed a partial mobilization, but in 1914 it was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
to see how the machinery for mobilization would work at full
power.</div>

<p>On the 19th and 20th July the magnificent naval force
formed by the assembly of the first, second, and third fleets,
with various flotillas of destroyers and submarines, was inspected
at Spithead by King George. After a few days' fleet
exercises in the Channel the great armament dispersed, the
first fleet going to Portland, the remainder to their home
ports to give man&#339;uvre leave. But in the meanwhile affairs
on the Continent became so threatening that it was deemed a
wise precaution to keep the first fleet in readiness where it
was, and to defer giving leave. On the 27th July Austria
declared war against Serbia. Two days later the first fleet
steamed out of Portland and disappeared from sight. Where
it went we do not know, but in a short time it and all our
other fleets were swallowed up in "the fog of war", from
which some of their ships have from time to time made
dramatic entrances upon the scene of conflict, generally
attended with unpleasant consequences to the enemy.</p>

<p>Events now moved with the greatest rapidity. Germany
declared war on Russia on 1st August, and on the day following
her troops violated the neutrality not only of Luxembourg but
of Belgium, although she&mdash;equally with Great Britain and
France&mdash;had guaranteed the neutrality of the latter country
by a formal treaty. On 3rd August the action of Germany
automatically brought France into the war, and on the same
day the mobilization of the British fleet was completed at four
o'clock in the morning. On the 4th the British ultimatum
was dispatched. It was summarily rejected, and by 11 p.m.
the two countries were at war.</p>

<p>The next morning the first shots were fired by the British
Navy. H.M.S. <i>Amphion</i>, a smart four-funnelled vessel of the
light-cruiser class, which, with a flotilla of destroyers, was on
patrol duty in the North Sea, was spoken by a trawler about
9 a.m., who reported having recently seen a suspicious steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
"throwing things overboard". The skipper described her
position as nearly as he could. It was easy to guess what
the "things" in question were. Germany had made little or
no secret of her intention to pursue a policy of strewing
mines in the open sea, though she had a fine fleet, only
second to our own, both in numbers and discipline. (Nelson,
it may be pointed out, won the battle of St. Vincent with
15 line-of-battle ships, 4 frigates, a brig and a cutter, although
he attacked an enemy fleet consisting of 27 line-of-battle ships,
7 of which carried more guns than any English ship, and 13
frigates.) We may well imagine the zest with which our
little squadron set off to punish the naval "dynamitards", and
it was not long before a mercantile-looking steamer hove in
sight, which proved to be the <i>Königin Luise</i>, of 2000 tons,
belonging to the Hamburg-Amerika Line. She was steering
east, and four destroyers shot after her like greyhounds unleashed.
The chase was good for about twenty knots, but
after a thirty-mile run the <i>Amphion</i> and destroyers opened
fire, which the German returned. The destroyer <i>Lance</i> now
crept up abreast of her on the port hand and fired<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> at comparatively
close quarters. Four shots did the trick. The
first absolutely wrecked her fore-bridge, the second got her
fair amidships between the funnels, while the last two made
such a mess of her stern that she began to founder.</p>

<p>With true British sportsmanship and humanity, every
attempt was at once made to rescue her crew, with the result
that twenty-eight escaped a watery grave. The <i>Amphion</i> and
her satellites, having disposed of the mine-layer, proceeded
with their work until about 6.30 the following morning.
The flotilla was at this time in the neighbourhood of the
spot where the <i>Königin Luise</i> had been dropping her mines.
Every precaution was taken to avoid what was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
be the dangerous area, but suddenly, without any warning,
the <i>Amphion</i> struck a mine and the catastrophe occurred.
"A sheet of flame instantly enveloped the bridge, rendered
the captain insensible, and he fell on the fore-and-aft bridge.
As soon as he recovered consciousness he ran to the engine-room
to stop the engines, which were still going at revolutions
for 20 knots. As all the fore part was on fire, it proved
impossible to reach the bridge or to flood the fore magazine.
The ship's back appeared to be broken, and she was already
settling down by the bows. All efforts were therefore
directed to placing the wounded in a place of safety, in case
of explosion, and towards getting her in tow by the stern.
By the time the destroyers closed, it was clearly time to
abandon the ship. They fell in for this purpose with the same
composure that had marked their behaviour throughout. All
was done without hurry or confusion, and twenty minutes
after the mine was struck the men, officers, and captain left
the ship."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>It was not long before the corner of the curtain shrouding
the North Sea was again raised for a moment to give us a
fleeting glimpse of the destruction of the German submarine
U15 by the cruiser <i>Birmingham</i>. There have been one or
two versions of this event. According to one account, the
look-outs on board the cruiser "spotted" the periscope of a
German submarine rather over a mile distant and opened
fire; and so good was the marksmanship of her gunners
that, small as was the target offered by the periscope, it was
carried away at the first shot. The submarine dived, but,
being unable to see where she was going, came to the surface,
only to have her conning-tower wrecked by another projectile,
which did so much damage that the U15 sank like a stone.
According to a well-known writer on naval matters<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> this
story, however, is "entirely fictitious, except in so far that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the <i>Birmingham</i> did sink the U 15; but the real truth of the
matter is that the U 15 fired at a certain British ship and
missed her. Thereafter the U 15 might have got home in
safety had not her captain imagined that he had succeeded,
and come to the surface to shout 'Deutschland über alles'.
That little incident settled the fate of the U 15, as she came
up alongside the <i>Birmingham</i> and was sunk at once."</p>

<p>This incident took place on the 9th August, and for the
next fortnight or so the "fog of war" rolled very thick over
the North Sea. There is reason to believe that things were
not exactly peaceful during all this time, since on the 19th
there was an official reference to some "desultory fighting",
resulting in no loss to either side. Between the 24th and 28th
the Germans sank twenty-two fishing-boats. Immediately
after, a well-planned move by the British Navy resulted in
what is known as the "Battle of the Bight". The rocky,
cliff-bound islet known as Heligoland&mdash;the German Gibraltar
of the North Sea covering the approaches to Cuxhaven and the
Kiel Canal&mdash;was not so long ago a British possession. It had
been ours for over a century when we exchanged it for Zanzibar,
because we thought "there was more money in it". We had
never made any use of it when we had it. Had we fortified
it, as the Germans have now done, its value in the war would
have been priceless. That we did not do so may be set down
to our fear of offending German susceptibilities and to our
fixed resolve not to contemplate a war with Germany as being
in the plane of practical politics. If any Government had
attempted to make an advanced naval base of it, what an
outcry there would have been!</p>

<p>It has been described by a German naval writer as "the
strategical basis of the German fleet, distant about 40 miles
from the mouths of the Elbe, the Weser, and the Jadhe. It is
a fortress of the most modern kind, furnished with the newest
weapons, and fortified with the utmost technical skill. Its
guns, contained in armour-plated revolving towers and bomb-proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
casemates, dominate the sea over a circle from 20 to 25
miles in diameter. Powerful moles, some 650 feet long, protect
the flotillas of torpedo-boats and submarines, and great
stores of ammunition and supplies facilitate the provisioning
of our ships."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Over and around this rock-bound fortress in the early
hours of the morning of 28th August hung a thick mist&mdash;almost
a light fog. Now and again the watchers on duty
caught sight of the phantom shapes of the German destroyers
and torpedo-boats as they carried out their never-ending sentry-go
over the approaches to the Elbe. Presently out at sea
there were ruddy glimmers through the haze, followed by the
slam of small cannon. Away to the westward, in a lift of the
mist, the German patrols suddenly "spotted" the porpoise-like
forms of three big submarines brazenly exposing themselves
on the surface, and a general dash was made in the direction
of this splendid "bag".</p>

<p>But they were too late. The intruders had dived, and
were out of sight or hearing. Then suddenly broke out a
rapid banging all round in the mist.</p>

<p>What was happening? As a matter of fact, our First and
Third Destroyer Flotillas, supported by the First Light-cruiser
Squadron, and with the First Battle-cruiser Squadron in
reserve, were carrying out an ingenious plan which was
described as "a scooping movement" against the German war-craft
known to be in the neighbourhood of Heligoland. Some
of our submarines were also playing their part, and it is probable
that the "scoop" was planned on information previously
gained by these little craft, since it was officially announced
by the Press Bureau, after the battle, that "the success of this
operation was due in the first instance to the information
brought to the admiral by the submarine officers, who have,
during the past three weeks, shown extraordinary daring and
enterprise in penetrating the enemy's waters".</p>

<span class="caption">THE SINKING OF THE GERMAN CRUISER <i>MAINZ</i><br />

A snapshot from one of the British war-ships engaged in the fight off Heligoland.</span>
</div>

<p>The three submarines were a decoy to draw the enemy's
flotillas to the westward. Then down came the saucy <i>Arethusa</i>,
looking not unlike a big destroyer herself, flying the broad
pennant of Commodore R. Y. Tyrwhitt, and the destroyers of
the Third Flotilla. The new-comers immediately attacked
the German Flotilla, which was now making for Heligoland.
The <i>Arethusa</i>, in her turn, was attacked by two German
cruisers, and there was something in the nature of a general
mêlée, in which the <i>Fearless</i> and the First Destroyer Flotilla
very shortly took a hand. Our gunnery seems to have been
the more effective, but all the same our flotillas were somewhat
hardly pressed until the Light Cruiser Squadron, and finally
the battle-cruisers, with their enormous guns, came looming
colossal out of the mist and gave the German cruisers the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>. The <i>Köln</i> and <i>Mainz</i> were set on fire and
sunk outright, the third cruiser, subsequently understood to
have been the <i>Ariadne</i>, disappeared blazing into the fog, only
to founder shortly afterwards, while two destroyers were also
accounted for. The <i>Arethusa</i> was somewhat damaged, and
was towed out of the fight by the <i>Fearless</i>. Of course, with
the arrival of our reinforcements, we were in overwhelming
superiority, and our principal risk lay in the enemy submarines,
which attempted an attack that was balked by the
high speed of our ships and the alertness of our destroyers.</p>

<p>A thrilling account of the engagement is contained in a
letter<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, written by a naval officer who evidently was serving
on board one of our destroyers. I do not think I can do better
than quote from it: "We destroyers went in and lured the enemy
out and had lots of excitement. The big fellows then came
up and did some excellent target practice, and we were very
glad to see them come; but they ought not to consider we had
a fight, because it was a massacre, not a fight. It was superb
generalship having overwhelming forces on the spot, but there
was really nothing for them to do except shoot the enemy,
even as Pa shoots pheasants. For us who put up the quarry
in its lair, there was no doubt more to do than 'shoot the
enemy', for in our case the shooting was passive and not
active only! For that very reason the fight did us of the
destroyers more good than it did our big fellows, for my
humble opinion, based on limited observation, is that no ship
is really herself until she has been under fire. The second
time she goes into action you may judge her character; she
is not likely to do normally well the first time. We all need
to be stiffened and then given a week or two to take it all in.
After that we are 'set'. A ship will always do better in her
second action. To see the old <i>Fearless</i> charging around the
field of fight (it was her second engagement) seeking fresh
foes was most inspiriting. Until the big brothers came up
she was absolutely all in all to us, and she has no bigger guns
than we have. I also learn that there is all the difference in
the world between a 4-inch gun in a cruiser and a 4-inch gun
in a destroyer. I would regard a cruiser armed with a 3-inch
as about a match for a destroyer with a 4-inch; but then
I have personally only looked at it from a destroyer point of
view. But it must be more unpleasant to have half a dozen
plumped accurately and together at you, with a well-arranged
'fire-control' guiding them, watching their fall, and applying
corrections to the range scientifically and dispassionately,
rather than to have isolated shots banged off from a vibrating
pulsating destroyer, turning this way and that, with no one
to look where the shot falls, except, perhaps, the captain, who
has a lot of other things to attend to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Have you ever watched a dog rush in on a flock of sheep
and scatter them? He goes for the nearest and barks at it,
goes so much faster than the flock that it bunches up with its
companions; the dog then barks at another and the sheep
spread out fanwise, so that all round in front of the dog is
a semicircle of sheep and behind him none. That was much
what we did at 7 a.m. on the 28th. The sheep were the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a><br /><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
torpedo-craft, who fell back just on the limits of range
and tried to lure us within fire of the Heligoland forts. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas
si bête!</i> But a cruiser came out and engaged our <i>Arethusa;</i>
they had a real heart-to-heart talk while we looked on, and a
few of us tried to shoot at the enemy too, though it was beyond
our distance. We were getting nearer and nearer Heligoland
all the time; there was a thick mist, and I expected every
minute to find the forts on the island bombarding us; so
<i>Arethusa</i> presently drew off after landing at least one good
shell on the enemy.</p>

<p>"Seeing our papers admit it, so may I&mdash;our fellows got
quite a nasty 'tummy-ache'. The enemy gave every bit as
good as he got there. We then re-formed, but a strong destroyer
belonging to the submarines got chased, and <i>Arethusa</i>
and <i>Fearless</i> went back to look after her, and we presently heard
a hot action astern. So the captain, who was in command of
the flotilla, turned us round and we went back to help, but
they had driven the enemy off, and on our arrival told us to
form up on the <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>

<p>"When we had partly formed and were very much bunched
together, a fine target, suddenly out of the 'everywhere'
arrived five shells not 150 yards away. We gazed at whence
they came, and again five or six stabs of fire pierced the mist,
and we made out a four-funnelled cruiser of the 'Breslau'
class. These five stabs were her guns going off, of course.
We waited fifteen seconds and the shots and the noise of the
guns arrived pretty simultaneously fifty yards away. Her
next salvo went over us, and I, personally, ducked as they
whirred overhead like a covey of fast partridges. You would
have supposed the captain had done this sort of thing all his
life; he gives me the impression of a Nelson officer who has
lived in a state of suspended animation since, but yet has kept
pace with the times, and is nowise perturbed at finding his
frigate a destroyer. He went full speed ahead at the first
salvo to string the bunch out and thus offer less target, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the commodore from the <i>Arethusa</i> made a signal to us to
attack with torpedoes.</p>

<p>"So we swung round at right angles and charged full speed
at the enemy, like a hussar attack. We got away at the start
magnificently and led the field, so that all the enemy's fire was
aimed at us for the next ten minutes. When we got so close
that the debris of their shells fell on board, we altered our
course and so threw them out in their reckoning of our speed,
and they had all their work to do over again. You follow that
with a destroyer coming at you at 30 knots it means that the
range is decreasing at the rate of about 150 yards per ten
seconds. When you see that your last shot fell, say, 100 yards
short, you put up 100 extra yards on your sights; but this
takes five seconds to do. When you have in this way discovered
his speed you put that correction in automatically;
a cruiser can do this, a destroyer has not room for the complicated
apparatus involved. Humanly speaking, therefore, the
captain, by twisting and turning at the psychological moment,
saved us; actually I feel we are in God's keeping these days.</p>

<p>"After ten minutes we got near enough to fire our torpedo,
and then turned back to the <i>Arethusa</i>. Next our
follower arrived just where we had been and fired his torpedo,
and of course the enemy fired at him, instead of at us. What
a blessed relief! It was like coming out of a really hot and
oppressive orchid house into the cool air of a summer garden.
A 'hot' fire is properly descriptive; it seems actually to be
hot! After the destroyers came the <i>Fearless</i>, and she stayed
on the scene, and soon we found she was engaging a three-funneller,
the <i>Mainz</i>. So off we started again to go for the
<i>Mainz</i>, the situation being, I take it, that crippled <i>Arethusa</i>
was too 'tummy'-aching to do anything but be defended by
us, her children.</p>

<p>"Scarcely, however, had we started (I did not feel the least
like another gruelling) when from out the mist and across our
front in furious pursuit came the First Cruiser Squadron, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Town class, <i>Birmingham</i>, &amp;c., each unit a match for three
<i>Mainz</i>, and as we looked and reduced speed they opened fire,
and the clear 'bang! bang!' of their guns was just a cooling
drink! To see a real big four-funneller spouting flame, which
flame denoted shells starting, and those shells not aimed at us
but for us, was the most cheerful thing possible. Even as
Kipling's infantryman, under heavy fire, cries 'The Guns,
thank Gawd, the Guns', when his own artillery has come into
action over his head, so did I feel as those 'Big Brothers' came
careering across.</p>

<p>"Once we were in safety I hated it. We had just been
having our own imaginations stimulated on the subject of
shells striking us, and now, a few minutes later, to see another
ship not three miles away reduced to a piteous mass of unrecognizability,
wreathed in black fumes, from which flared
out angry gouts of fire like Vesuvius in eruption, as an unending
stream of 100-pound shells burst on board; it just pointed
the moral and showed us what might have been! The <i>Mainz</i>
was immensely gallant. The last I saw of her, absolutely
wrecked alow and aloft, her whole midships a fuming inferno,
she had one gun forward and one aft still spitting forth fury
and defiance, 'like a wild cat mad with wounds'. Our own
four-funnelled friend recommenced at this juncture with a
couple of salvos, but rather half-heartedly; and we really did
not care a &mdash;&mdash;, for there, straight ahead of us in lordly
procession, like elephants walking through a pack of 'pi-dogs',
came the <i>Lion</i>, <i>Queen Mary</i>, <i>Invincible</i>, and <i>New Zealand</i>,
our battle-cruisers. Great and grim and uncouth as some
antediluvian monsters, how solid they looked, how utterly
earth-quaking.</p>

<p>"We pointed out our latest aggressor to them, whom they
could not see from where they were, and they passed down
the field of battle with the little destroyers on their left and
the destroyed on their right, and we went west while they
went east, and turned north between poor four-funnels and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
her home, and just a little later we heard the thunder of their
guns for a space, then all silence, and we knew. Then wireless:
'<i>Lion</i> to all ships and destroyers; retire'. That was all.</p>

<p>"Remains only little details, only one of which I will tell
you. The most romantic, dramatic, and piquant episode that
modern war can ever show. The <i>Defender</i>, having sunk an
enemy, lowered a whaler to pick up her swimming survivors;
before the whaler got back an enemy's cruiser came up and
chased the <i>Defender</i>, and thus she abandoned her whaler.
Imagine their feelings; alone in an open boat without food,
twenty-five miles from the nearest land, and that land the
enemy's fortress, with nothing but fog and sea around them.
Suddenly a swirl alongside, and up, if you please, pops His
Britannic Majesty's submarine E 4, opens his conning-tower,
takes them all on board, shuts up again, dives, and brings
them home 250 miles! Is not that magnificent? No novel
would dare face the critics with an episode like that in it,
except, perhaps, Jules Verne&mdash;and all true!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"Submarined." (From <cite>The Battleship</cite>, by Walter Wood, 1912.)</span><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> next phase of the naval operations in the Channel and
North Sea does not afford quite such satisfactory reading as
the "Battle of the Bight", for the loss of several of our cruisers
and smaller vessels by mine and torpedo has to be recorded.
At the same time the very fact that our ships were at sea, and
so offering a target to the German submarines, while their
ships were hiding under the fortifications of Kiel and Heligoland,
must not be lost sight of.</div>

<p>If we claim command of the sea we must face the risks of
the position. The sinking of a few men-of-war by mines or
submarines will not transfer the "trident of Neptune" to a
fleet which only plays for safety, any more than the destruction
of one or two public buildings by a dynamitard will give
him the reins of government. The "silver lining" to the cloud
of our losses in men and material is the magnificent bravery
and discipline displayed by the crews of the vessels attacked,
officers, seamen, and marines alike. Space forbids a detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
account of each of these losses, but it is as well to mention
them.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Speedy</i> and <i>Pathfinder</i>, small cruisers of mature
age, were blown up, the first by a mine, the second by a submarine,
during September. In the month of October the
cruiser <i>Hawke</i>, when in company with the <i>Theseus</i> in the
North Sea, was attacked and torpedoed by a German submarine,
while the <i>Hermes</i>, fitted as a tender for aeroplanes,
was sunk in a similar way in the Channel, where, on the 27th,
the German submarine service went so far as to torpedo the
French steamer <i>Amiral Ganteaume</i>, crowded as she was
with 2500 refugees. The biggest and most dramatic of the
losses occasioned by the enemy submarines was the torpedoing
of the three big cruisers <i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Cressy</i>, and <i>Hogue</i> on the
morning of 22nd September. The ships were by no means
new, and their loss is not to be compared with that of the
many gallant men who formed their crews.</p>

<p>To quote the official statement issued to the Press: "The
duty on which these vessels were engaged was an essential
part of the arrangements by which the control of the seas and
the safety of the country are maintained, and the lives lost are
as usefully, as necessarily, and as gloriously devoted to the
requirements of His Majesty's Service as if the loss had been
incurred in a general action." The ships were in the neighbourhood
of the Hook of Holland when they were attacked
by the U 9&mdash;alone, according to the German story, though
some of the survivors think there were more, and claim that
one was sunk. The <i>Aboukir</i> was the first victim, and the
other ships, seeing her plight, stopped, or at any rate reduced
their speed, to lower their boats to pick up her men, thus
giving the enemy an opportunity of torpedoing them also
which he was not slow to take advantage of.</p>

<p>"The natural promptings of humanity have in this case
led to heavy losses which would have been avoided by a strict
adherence to military considerations," remarked the authorized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
statement published by the Press Bureau, which went on to
point out the necessity of this rule being observed, especially
in the case of large ships.</p>

<p>The material loss inflicted on the navy by the loss of the
<i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Cressy</i>, and <i>Hogue</i> was not great. The three ships
were all designed as far back as 1898, which may perhaps
account for the rapidity with which they foundered, since the
torpedo at that time was by no means so formidable, either
as regards range, accuracy, or explosive effect, as those of to-day.
It is probable, therefore, that the precautions against
these weapons, in the shape of internal subdivision, were not
so extensive as in our more modern ships of war. The
<i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Cressy</i>, and <i>Hogue</i> were among our very oldest
armoured cruisers, and, big as they were, had a comparatively
light armament considering their 12,000 tons of displacement.</p>

<p>Considering the extremely limited opportunities afforded
by the coyness of the German so-called "High Seas Fleet",
our submarines and destroyers retaliated fairly effectively.
The E 9, one of our newest submarines, commanded by Lieutenant-Commander
Max K. Horton, R.N., torpedoed the <i>Hela</i>,
a light 2000-ton cruiser of an old type, on 13th September.
The ship was not a great loss to the German Navy, as she was
quite an old stager, dating from 1895, but the exploit was
a notable one, being carried out, as it was, well behind the
Island of Heligoland, that very formidable German naval
fortress.</p>

<p>The same boat scored another success on 6th October,
when she sighted two German destroyers patrolling off the
mouth of the Ems, not far from the island of Borkum, and
managed to torpedo one of them&mdash;the S 126, of 420 tons.
"It was an easier case than that of the <i>Hela</i>," said one of
the E9's crew on her return to Harwich, "but luck was
with us."</p>

<p>"When we rose," he said, "we saw two German destroyers
travelling at a speed of some 30 knots. Our commander was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
at the periscope, and ordered the forward tubes to be fired."
They then rose to the surface, and the commander said: "Look
at her; the beggar is going down." Then they saw the German
rise perpendicularly, and men rushed up to her stern and
dived into the water. The submarine then submerged and
made her way back.</p>

<p>"I don't want to boast," continued the narrator, "but we
got our 'rooties'<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> home. It was not a bad performance."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Again, a smart little action was fought on the afternoon
of 17th October between the light cruiser <i>Undaunted</i>, commanded
by Captain Fox, who was blown up in the <i>Amphion</i>&mdash;with
the destroyers <i>Lance</i>, <i>Lennox</i>, <i>Legion</i>, and <i>Loyal</i>, and
four German destroyers, all of which were sunk.</p>

<p>"We steamed out of Harwich," wrote an officer who was
engaged, "with all the ships' companies jubilant and eager
to get into the danger zone, as it was reported that a 'certain
amount of liveliness' prevailed in the North Sea.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> All was
quiet till two o'clock, when, heading up northwards and skirting
the Dutch coast-line, we sighted the smoke of four vessels.
Our captain immediately cleared for action, and signalled the
order to chase. We steamed at top speed, with two destroyers
disposed on either side of us. It was a never-to-be-forgotten
sight&mdash;nerves strained to their utmost tension, and everybody
as keen as mustard. Sea and spray flew all over us, and
covered us fore and aft. The German destroyers turned about
and fled, but we had the advantage in speed, soon got within
range with our 6-inch bow gun, and opened fire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Once
within effective range our 4-inch semi-automatic guns blazed
away, the destroyers acting independently. The Germans,
seeing themselves cornered, altered course, with the intention
of obtaining a better strategic position. Most of their shooting
was aimed at the destroyers. Lusty cheers rang from our
ships as the first German destroyer disappeared. A 6-inch
lyddite shell struck her just below the bridge. She toppled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
over on her beam-ends like a wounded bird, then righted herself
level with the surface, and finally plunged, bow first, all
in about two minutes.</p>

<div class="caption">&quot;MISSED!&quot;; THE HELM THE BEST WEAPON AGAINST TORPEDOES<br />

<p>This picture illustrates an incident which has frequently occurred in the patrol flotillas when destroyers have been hunting down
submarines and the latter have retaliated by firing torpedoes. Clever man&#339;uvring in combination with good gunnery is the
war-ship's best protection against attack by submarine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"We had by this time closed, and the enemy commenced
firing their torpedoes. They must have discharged at least
eight, one missing our stern by only a few yards. Fortunately
for us, we caught sight of the bubbles on the surface
denoting its track, and just missed the fate of the <i>Aboukir</i>,
<i>Cressy</i>, <i>Hogue</i>, and <i>Hawke</i> by a hairbreadth. At 2·55 p.m.
the second of the enemy's vessels was seen to be out of action,
being ablaze fore and aft, showing the fearful havoc our
lyddite shells were making. As each shell hit its mark,
funnels, bridge, torpedo-tubes, and all the deck fittings disappeared
like magic, dense fumes from the explosive covering
the vessels fore and aft. We actually passed over the spot
where the first vessel had sunk, and just for the space of a
couple of seconds, as we were tearing through the water at
over 30 knots an hour, we caught sight of scores of poor
wretches floating about and clinging to charred and blackened
debris and wreckage. This was truly a pitiable sight, but
as we had two more combatants to put out of action, to stop
at such close range, even to save life, would have been courting
disaster. We should have been merely exposing ourselves
to torpedoes. We had to tear along and try and forget the
gruesome result of our work. The second ship, now a mass
of seething flame, sank quite level with the water, and we soon
had the remaining two literally holed and maimed. Their
firing was very poor and inaccurate, although several shells
flew around, throwing shrapnel bullets about. It was a marvel
that none struck us. The <i>Loyal</i> and <i>Lennox</i> got quite near
one of the German vessels. The surviving German fired her
last torpedo, which, however, went wide of the mark. During
these activities we had closed in with the last of the Kaiser's
destroyers, and placed her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. The <i>Legion</i> had
two wounded. By 3·30 the action was over, and the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
fleet had been reduced by four units. Then came the order
to get out boats and save life. Altogether we saved 2 officers
and 29 men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Those wretched Teutons made a good fight.
They were, of course, completely outmatched."</p>

<p>A few days afterwards the destroyer <i>Badger</i> did a smart
piece of work in ramming and destroying a German submarine
off the Dutch coast. The Admiralty wired to her
commanding officer&mdash;Commander C. A. Fremantle&mdash;that they
were "very pleased with your good service". But about the
same time our submarine E 3 was reported to have been lost
in the North Sea. The navy made rather a surprise appearance
on the Belgian coast towards the end of October, enfilading
the right of the German attack on Nieuport, which was
being stoutly defended by the Belgians, and formed the extreme
left of the "far-flung battle line" of the Allies. Three
"Monitors"&mdash;novel craft in our service&mdash;which had been
building for Brazil, but had been taken up by the Admiralty
at the outbreak of war, played the leading part to begin with,
but later on other heavier ships took a hand in the proceedings.
The "Monitors" were especially well adapted for work
in the shallow waters between Dunkirk and Zeebrügge. Their
appearance was unexpected by the Germans, who suffered
severely from their fire, and were unable to press their attack
against Nieuport. The "Monitors" <i>Mersey</i>, <i>Severn</i>, and <i>Humber</i>,
assisted by destroyers and a French flotilla, steamed within
a couple of miles of the shore and were in action from 6 a.m.
till 6 p.m. on the first day. Their fire was incessant, one vessel
alone firing 1000 lyddite and shrapnel shells. The German
trenches, which were about 3 miles inland, were especially
aimed at, and the most terrible execution was done upon the
troops in them. The German batteries among the big sand-dunes
along the beach also came in for a good deal of attention.
One battery of field-guns was entirely wiped out, a
train collected to force the passage of the Yser was totally
dispersed, an ammunition column blown up, and General von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Tripp and the whole of his staff, who were near Westende,
were killed.</p>

<p>The Germans seemed unable to make an effective reply,
and even an aeroplane sent up to signal the ranges by smoke-balls
proved a failure. By the end of the day the Germans
had lost 4000 men and had been driven from the coast, where
nothing was visible but dense masses of black smoke and lurid
patches of flame. The British fire was extremely rapid, some
of the guns firing no less than fourteen rounds a minute at
times. A few casualties were suffered by the British, but no
material damage of a serious nature was sustained, although
exposed both to gun-fire and, it is stated, to submarine attacks,
which were warded off by the attendant destroyers.</p>

<p>The British Navy continued to do valuable work on the
Belgian coast for a considerable time. The <i>Venerable</i>, a pre-Dreadnought
battleship, did great execution with her big
12-inch guns, which outranged the German batteries. In
November, Zeebrügge, where the enemy had established a
submarine station, was heavily bombarded and considerable
damage done. The British casualties during these coastal
operations were but slight. The destroyer <i>Falcon</i>, however,
received one very destructive shell, which killed 1 officer and
8 men and wounded 1 officer and 15 men.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>In the Outer Seas</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"The idea that an inferior power, keeping its battleships in port and
declining fleet actions, can, nevertheless, bring the trade of an enemy to a
standstill, has no basis either in reason or experience."</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Sir George Sydenham Clarke.</span><br />
</div></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> had been generally understood that the German programme
of hostilities against this country&mdash;when the "selected moment"
arrived&mdash;was to deliver a sudden blow with the full
force of their fleet against ours, before the declaration of war
and during a time of "strained relations". The first move
would probably have been made by submarines and destroyers,
and it was hoped that after a successful surprise attack, before
war was declared, the German High Seas Fleet would be
stronger than the residuum of our own.</div>

<p>For various reasons, which we have not room to discuss
here, the Germans had made up their minds that in August,
1914, Great Britain would <em>not</em> fight, and that they would be
able to carry out their programme against France, Russia,
and Belgium, after which they would decide exactly their
selected moment to attack us. At the outbreak of war their
High Seas Fleet was apparently lying in different deep fiords
on the Norwegian coast. What it was doing there, goodness
only knows; but we may be sure it was not for anybody's
good, except, possibly, Germany's.</p>

<p>Anyway, these ships were not in a position to carry out
the programme laid down for war with England, and so
scurried back to the security of their fortified bases. So, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
they were not quite ready for raiding our commerce. Still,
they were able to put a good many cruisers, regular and
auxiliary, on the ocean highways, and for a time gave us a
good deal of trouble. In the Mediterranean they had the big
battle-cruiser <i>Goeben</i> and the small cruiser <i>Breslau</i>, and on
the morning of 4th August these two ships bombarded Bona
and Philippeville on the Algerian coast. They did but little
damage; in fact, it was merely a "runaway knock". The
next morning they arrived at Messina, a neutral port, where
they had either to remain indefinitely and be disarmed or
leave within a prescribed period. The German officers decided
to leave, and after a theatrical business of devoting themselves
to death, and depositing their wills and private papers with
the German Consul&mdash;taking good care to report this to the
Berlin Press, which published glowing accounts of the "mad
daring" of their devoted seamen&mdash;they got under way and
steamed out, with colours flying and bands playing.</p>

<p>Soon after midnight&mdash;6th-7th August&mdash;the look-outs on
board the <i>Gloucester</i>, a light cruiser carrying no heavier gun
than a 6-inch, "spotted" them moving along under cover of
the land. After steering a parallel course for some time she
crossed their sterns to get between them and the land in order
to see them better, and hung closely to them all night and
morning. "We let the two ships go on under cover of the
darkness," wrote one of the crew, "and they were moving
without lights at about 23 knots, and then followed almost
at full speed. The <i>Goeben</i> went on ahead, and the <i>Breslau</i>
not far behind her. Just about two o'clock the <i>Breslau</i> slowed
down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As far as we could tell she fired two torpedoes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
then discharged several salvoes from her 4-inch guns.
We at once replied with our fore 6-inch gun, and, although
it was dark, we found that with the second shell we cleared
her quarter-deck.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Neither the torpedoes nor shells from
the <i>Breslau</i> hit their mark.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Although they were slightly
faster vessels, we kept our distance from them without losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
anything all day, and in the afternoon sighted the Greek
coast after having made the fastest run across that open bit
of water that ever was made. The weather was fine, and
there was not a sight of another war-ship except the Germans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
When they were off Cape Matapan, the most southerly
point of the Greek mainland, the <i>Breslau</i> stopped again, as
she had done in the night, and waited for us to come on. This
time we did not wait for her to open fire, but discharged our
fore 6-inch gun directly we got within range."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>"After the first shot," wrote another <i>Gloucester</i>, "our lads
were quite happy, and they kept firing as quickly as possible.
One chap near swallowed his 'chew of 'baccy' when the first
shot fell short. The next one he spat on for luck, and it took
half the <i>Breslau's</i> funnel away. He repeated the operation
on the next shot, which cleared her quarter-deck and put her
after-gun out of action. Then he began to smile."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>This interchange of compliments lasted nearly five-and-twenty
minutes. The <i>Breslau</i> fired heavily, but, though her
gunnery was good, she had nothing bigger than a 4-inch gun,
and the <i>Gloucester</i> was so well handled by her captain&mdash;W.
A. H. Kelly, M.V.O.&mdash;that every salvo arrived just after
she had left the spot where it arrived. At last the big <i>Goeben</i>
turned slowly round and approached the plucky little British
cruiser and opened fire, but without effect. As a single shot
from her heavy guns would have put the <i>Gloucester</i> out of
action, and probably sunk her, she withdrew in accordance
with her instructions. The <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i> eventually
arrived at Constantinople, where the farce of a sale to Turkey
was carried out; but they left behind a good deal of the
prestige of the German Navy and a new phrase for our bluejackets'
vocabulary&mdash;the "<i>Goeben</i> glide"&mdash;that is, to "skedaddle
rather than fight".</p>

<p>About five German cruisers were known to be in the
Atlantic, and a considerable force of both our own and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
French cruisers set to work to "round them up". The <i>König
Wilhelm der Grosse</i>, a big armed mercantile cruiser of 14,000
tons and ten 4-inch guns, was "bagged" by the <i>Highflyer</i> off
the Oro River on the West African coast on 26th August. She
had sunk three of our merchantmen, and was holding up a
couple more when the <i>Highflyer</i> hove in sight. The German,
a much faster vessel, was made fast to a captured collier, from
which she was coaling, which enabled the <i>Highflyer</i>, which
dated from 1900, to get within range with her heavier guns.
"If all British ships shoot as straight as the <i>Highflyer</i>," said
the captain of <i>König Wilhelm der Grosse</i>, "I shall be sorry
for our poor fellows in the North Sea." Nearly a month later
the <i>Carmania</i>, a big armed liner, sank the <i>Cap Trafalgar</i>,
a similar vessel&mdash;which was disguised as a "Castle" liner
with grey hull and red funnels&mdash;off the Island of Trinidad to
the eastward of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>"We sighted the German", wrote an officer on board the
<i>Carmania</i>, "about 10 a.m. on 14th September, in the South
Atlantic. She was coaling from a collier, and two others were
standing off. On sighting us the <i>Cap Trafalgar</i> hurried off,
smothering the colliers, and soon after the latter steered to the
eastward and the <i>Cap Trafalgar</i> to the southwards. We
steamed after her at top speed, and when about 4 miles off,
she turned and steered towards us. We were cleared for
action, and had been standing by our guns for some time,
all strangely fascinated by the movements of our enemy.
When about 3½ miles off we fired our challenge shot across
her bows, and immediately after this she displayed her
colours at the masthead, and fired her first shot from her starboard
after-guns. This shot came right close over our heads,
dropping in the water. Then the firing from both ships became
fast and furious. Projectiles and splinters from bursting
shells showered around us. The engagement began at 12.10
midday and lasted hot until about 1.10 p.m., when she showed
signs of having been badly hit, and was taking a heavy list to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
starboard, and was on fire fore and aft. We were also on fire
on our fore-bridge. Our bridge-telegraphs and steering-gear
were completely wrecked, and the captain's cabin, the chart-house,
and a number of officers' quarters were gutted. We
were also badly holed by her fire. When we found we had
crippled our enemy, and that she was sinking, we ceased firing,
although her colours were still flying. She gradually listed
over till her funnels nearly touched the water. Then she
settled down forward till her second funnel almost disappeared.
At last she rolled over, showing her keel and propellers, stood
up on end, and gradually assumed a perpendicular position
and dived out of sight.</p>

<p>"We could make out some boats with survivors, and one of
the colliers rendered assistance. We had to clear away, because
low down on the horizon the signalman saw smoke and
what appeared to be the <i>Dresden</i>. We steered away south,
and then doubled on our course. By that time darkness was
setting in, and we thus escaped her clutches."</p>

<p>An auxiliary cruiser, of course, would not stand much
chance in a duel with a man-of-war cruiser, as was shown by
that between the <i>Highflyer</i> and the <i>König Wilhelm der
Grosse</i>, a much newer, larger, and faster ship. Rather later in
the year the <i>Navarra</i>, another German auxiliary cruiser of
the Hamburg-Amerika line, was sunk also in South Atlantic
waters by the British auxiliary cruiser <i>Orama</i>, an Orient liner.
The Germans do not appear to have put up much of a fight,
and the British gunnery proved much superior, but details are
wanting.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>If space permitted, a good deal more might be written
about the cruiser operations in the Atlantic, but we have now
to turn our attention to the Indian Ocean. The first incident
to be noticed is an adverse one to the British. The <i>Pegasus</i>,
a small cruiser dating from 1899, after having in conjunction
with the <i>Astrea</i> destroyed the German wireless station at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Dar-es-Salem, and sunk the gunboat <i>Möwe</i> and a floating-dock,
was caught while overhauling her machinery in the harbour
of Zanzibar by the German light cruiser <i>Königsberg</i>, a much
newer vessel.</p>

<p>The <i>Königsberg</i> approached at full speed at five o'clock on
Sunday morning, 20th September, and, having sunk the British
patrol boat by three shots, opened fire on the <i>Pegasus</i> from
5 miles distance, closing to 7000 yards. The <i>Pegasus</i>, being
at anchor, presented an easy target, and the German fire was
so well directed that in a quarter of an hour the only guns
she could bring to bear were put out of action.</p>

<p>After an interval the German re-opened fire for another
fifteen minutes, after which she stood out to sea. The British
crew, caught under such disadvantageous circumstances, showed
true heroism, though, as may be supposed, they suffered very
severely. The ensign was twice shot away, but afterwards
held up proudly by hand by two men of the detachment of
Royal Marines, who stationed themselves in the most conspicuous
place they could find. One was killed by a shell and
his place was at once taken by another comrade. The <i>Pegasus</i>
was holed badly on the water-line, her fires had to be put out,
and she was run aground in shallow water but subsequently
driven by wind and tide into deeper water, where she sank.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that the German light cruiser
<i>Emden</i> began to gain notoriety. She had belonged to the
German squadron in China, but had slipped away south, and
now began to sink one after another of our merchantmen in
the Indian Ocean. This was in contravention of international
law, but as, generally speaking, her commander, Captain
Müller, saved their crews, and showed both dash and humanity,
the British public were more or less inclined to look with
a lenient eye on his semi-piratical proceedings. He fired
a few shots at Madras and destroyed an oil-tank, and at
Singapore torpedoed the <i>Jemtchug</i>, a Russian gunboat, and
the <i>Mousquet</i>, a French destroyer. The <i>Emden</i> was enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to approach unsuspected on account of having rigged up an
extra funnel and hoisted Japanese colours. However, her day
was yet to come.</p>

<p>By this time British, Russian, Japanese, and French
cruisers in the East were on the qui vive, as well as those
belonging to the newly-formed fleet of the Australian Commonwealth,
and it is to one of the Australian cruisers, the <i>Sydney</i>,
that the honour of ridding the seas of the "wanted" <i>Emden</i>
belongs. On 9th November the raiding German arrived at
the Cocos Keeling Islands, an isolated group in the Indian
Ocean, and, landing a party of men, set about destroying the
British wireless station. Luckily the operators were suspicious
of the strange craft, and managed to get off a message which
reached the cruisers <i>Melbourne</i> and <i>Sydney</i> in a somewhat
broken condition. "Strange warship&mdash;off entrance" it ran.
This was about seven in the morning, when they were 50
miles to the eastward of the islands, and in charge of a
convoy. The <i>Melbourne</i>, as senior officer, ordered the <i>Sydney</i>
off at full speed to investigate. Before half-past nine the tops
of the <i>Emden's</i> funnels were made out close to the feathery
palm tops denoting the position of the Cocos. She was 10 or
14 miles distant, but she "spotted" the <i>Sydney</i>, and very soon
opened fire at a tremendous range.</p>

<p>"Shortly after, we started in on her," wrote one of the
<i>Sydney's</i> officers.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> "The Australian opened fire from her
port guns. Before long a shot from the <i>Emden</i> knocked out
nearly the whole gun's crew of No. 2 gun on the starboard
side."</p>

<p>"There was a lot of 'Whee-oo, whee-oo, whee-oo'," continued
the officer above quoted, "and the 'But-but-but' of the shell
striking the water beyond, and, as the range was pretty big,
this was quite possible, as the angle of descent would be pretty
steep. Coming aft, I heard a shot graze the top of No. 1
Starboard. A petty-officer now came up limping from aft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and said that he had just carried an officer below (he was not
dangerously hit) and that the after-control position had been
knocked right out, and everyone wounded (they were marvellously
lucky). I told him if he was really able to carry on
to go aft to No. 2 Starboard and see there was no fire, and, if
there was, that any charges about were to be thrown overboard
at once. He was very game and limped away aft. He
got aft to find a very bad cordite fire just starting. He, with
others, got this put out. I later noticed some smoke rising
aft, and ran aft to find it was but the remnant of what they
had put out, but found two men, one with a pretty badly
wounded foot, sitting on the gun-platform, and a petty-officer
lying on the deck a little farther aft with a nasty wound in
his back. I found one of the men was unwounded but badly
shaken. However, he pulled himself together when I spoke
to him, and told him I wanted him to do what he could for
the wounded. I then ran back to my group.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>"All the time we were going at 25 and sometimes as
much as 26 knots. We had the speed of the <i>Emden</i> and
fought as suited ourselves.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Best of all was to see the
gun-crews fighting their guns quite unconcerned. When we
were last in Sydney, we took on board three boys from the
training-ship <i>Tingira</i> who had volunteered. The captain
said: 'I don't really want them, but as they are keen, I'll take
them'. Now the action was only a week or two afterwards,
but the two out of the three who were directly under my
notice were perfectly splendid. One little slip of a boy did
not turn a hair, and worked splendidly. The other boy, a
very sturdy youngster, carried projectiles from the hoist to
his gun throughout the action without so much as thinking of
cover. I do think that for two boys absolutely new to their
work they were splendid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Coming aft the port side from
the forecastle gun, I was met by a lot of men cheering and
waving their caps. I said: 'What's happened?' 'She's gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
sir, she's gone!' I ran to the ship's side and no sign of a ship
could I see. If one could have seen a dark cloud of smoke it
would have been different. But I could see no sign of anything.
So I called out: 'All hands turn out the life-boats;
there will be men in the water'. They were just starting to
do this when someone called out: 'She's still firing, sir,' and
everyone ran back to the guns.</p>

<p>"What had happened was, a cloud of yellow or very light-coloured
smoke had obscured her from view, so that looking
in her direction one's impression was that she had totally
disappeared. Later we turned again and engaged her on the
other broadside. By now her three funnels and her foremast
had been shot away, and she was on fire aft. We turned
again, and after giving her a salvo or two with the starboard
guns, saw her run ashore on North Keeling Island. So at
11.20 a.m. we ceased firing, the action having lasted one hour
forty minutes. Our hits were not very serious. We were
'hulled' in about three places. The shell that exploded in the
boys' mess-deck, apart from ruining the poor little beggars'
clothes, provided a magnificent stock of trophies. For two or
three days they kept finding fresh pieces. The only important
damage was the after control-platform, which is one mass of
gaping holes and tangled iron, and the foremost range-finder
shot away. Other hits, though 'interesting', don't signify."
As for the <i>Emden</i>, she was a perfect shambles. Her voice-pipes
had been shot away early in the action, and, with the
exception of the forecastle, everything was wrecked on the
upper deck. The German party on shore seized a schooner,
the <i>Ayesha</i>, and contrived to escape to sea.</p>

<p>Thus ended the adventurous career of the <i>Emden</i>, by far
the most successful of the German commerce-raiders. In
seven weeks she had destroyed something like 70,000 tons of
British shipping, so that the news of her suppression was most
welcome in Great Britain. But no one who has not been in
Australia will be able to realize the delight and exultation the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
news of the <i>Sydney's</i> exploit brought to the people of that
island continent. That one of their own ships, out of the
many that were looking out for the <i>Emden</i>, should so effectively
have disposed of her was the most magnificent and
acceptable news that could be imagined, and it is hoped that
her guns will be salved and placed as trophies in the big
Australian cities.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously another sea-wasp, the <i>Königsberg</i>,
the same vessel which had so mauled the <i>Pegasus</i>, besides
doing other mischief among our merchant-shipping, was
"cornered" by the cruiser <i>Chatham</i> in the Rufigi River on the
East Coast of Africa. Harried this way and that by our
cruisers, she at last took refuge so far up the river that she
was out of range from the <i>Chatham's</i> guns. At the same time
she landed a party of her men on an island at the mouth of
the river with Maxims and quick-firing guns. Here they
entrenched themselves. The British at once sent secretly to
Zanzibar and procured a steamer&mdash;the <i>Newbridge</i>&mdash;loaded
with 1500 tons of coal, which, upon arrival, they deliberately
anchored across the river channel, in spite of the fire directed
upon them by the German detachment on the island. When
all was ready, her crew took to their boats, blew three holes
in her bottom, and sank her, effectually "bottling up" the
<i>Königsberg</i>. Several casualties were incurred during this
operation. The German cruiser after this contrived to conceal
her exact position for some time, by fastening the tops of
palm-trees to her masts, but an aeroplane, being brought down
the coast in the <i>Kinfauns Castle</i>, flew over her and indicated
her position by means of smoke bombs, enabling her to be
fired at, at long range, by the 12-inch guns of the battleship
<i>Goliath</i>, which had now arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>Powerful as were the battleship's guns, they were unable
to effect her destruction. It was not until several months had
elapsed that the British Navy was able to finish off the
German cruiser. The work was eventually carried out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
little monitors <i>Severn</i> and <i>Mersey</i>, which had made their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debut</i>
on the Belgian coast. While the <i>Weymouth</i> and <i>Pioneer</i> engaged
the guns on the island and others which had been
mounted on the river bank, the two monitors steamed up the
river and engaged the <i>Königsberg</i>. The battle lasted for a
long time, as the raider was so ensconced in jungle that the
airmen who were "spotting" for the British found the greatest
difficulty in seeing where their shot fell. Most of the time the
German got six guns to bear on the monitors, and generally
fired salvoes. After six hours her masts were still standing,
but shortly afterwards she was set on fire by a salvo from the
monitors. Her effective guns were reduced to one, and before
long she ceased fire altogether.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A sad</span> but glorious day in the annals of the British Navy
has now to be referred to&mdash;the defeat of Sir Christopher
Cradock's squadron off the coast of Chile, with the loss of
the <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i> with all hands. Sad because
of the defeat and the loss of so many gallant officers and men&mdash;glorious
on account of the way they fought and met their
deaths. It is the only thing approaching a naval victory
scored by the Germans up to the time of writing.</div>

<p>The German squadron, which was commanded by Admiral
Graf von Spee, consisted of the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, <i>Gneisenau</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<i>Dresden</i>, <i>Nürnberg</i>, and <i>Leipzig</i>. The two former had been on
the Chinese station and were big armoured cruisers of 11,600
tons, dating from 1907. They were sister ships, each mounting
eight 8·2-inch, six 6-inch, and several smaller guns. The
<i>Scharnhorst</i> (flag) was the crack gunnery ship of the German
fleet. The other three ships were third-class cruisers
of between 3000 and 4000 tons, similar to the <i>Emden</i>, and
carried ten 4·1-inch guns apiece, firing 34-pound projectiles.
They had been carrying on various separate commerce-raiding
operations in the Pacific, had bombarded the French port of
Papeete in Tahiti, and now, when the numerous cruisers of
the allied Powers were beginning to make the Pacific Ocean
"unhealthy" for them, had apparently concentrated off the
Chilian coast with the view of slipping out of it into the
Atlantic in hopes of doing further mischief, after capturing
the Falkland Islands as a base, or possibly of eventually
attempting to find their way back to a German port.</p>

<p>On 1st November at 2 p.m. a British squadron consisting of
the <i>Good Hope</i> (14,100 tons), <i>Monmouth</i> (9800 tons), <i>Glasgow</i>
(4800 tons), and <i>Otranto</i> (12,100 tons) were at sea to the
westward of Coronel, in Chile, when it was reported that
there were enemy's ships in the neighbourhood. The two
first-named ships were armoured cruisers of large size, but
not too well gunned for their displacement. The <i>Good Hope</i>
had a couple of 9·2-inch guns and sixteen 6-inch guns, the
<i>Monmouth</i> fourteen 6-inch guns. The <i>Glasgow</i> was a light
cruiser with two 6-inch and ten 4-inch guns, while the <i>Otranto</i>
was merely a big mail-boat, belonging to the Orient line,
armed as a mercantile auxiliary.</p>

<p>At 4.20 the smoke of hostile ships was made out on the
horizon, and about a quarter to six the British squadron was
formed in line ahead in the order in which their names have
been already noted. The enemy came in sight about this
time at 12 miles distance, but kept away as long as the sun
was above the horizon, as it showed them up well to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
gunners and was in the eyes of their own. As soon as it
dipped, the light was entirely in their favour. The grey
forms of their ships were but dimly discernible, whilst ours
were silhouetted black against the ruddy glow of the sunset.</p>

<p>The following account of the action is from the pen of
one of the crew of the <i>Glasgow:</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> "By 6 p.m. we were steaming
abreast each other. The <i>Monmouth</i>, as she passed us close on
our port side, gave us a few cheers, which were readily returned.
Everyone was stripped and ready, and all seemed
satisfied to think that we had found the enemy after searching
for nearly three months. The sea was still very rough, and
the ships were washing down forward. The enemy's squadron
seemed to be going faster than we were, and were getting on
our port bow. The sun was setting in the west, and we must
have made very nice targets for the Germans, as we were
between them and the sun. They had some dark clouds
behind them and were difficult to see even then. As soon
as the sun had set they altered course towards us, and we
turned slightly towards them, the <i>Otranto</i> going away off our
starboard quarter and taking no part in the action. As soon
as the enemy were within 14,000 yards they opened fire, each
of the armoured ships firing at the <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i>,
while the two smaller ships concentrated their fire on the
<i>Glasgow</i>, although they did not open fire until the fourth ship
had joined them and they had got much closer than when the
armoured ships opened fire.</p>

<p>"The <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i> returned the enemy's fire,
and soon the action became general. We were very close to
each other on the British side, but the Germans were much
farther apart. The enemy soon got the range of our ships
and were hitting the <i>Good Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i> very
often, and it was not long before the <i>Good Hope</i> was on fire.
Soon after the <i>Monmouth</i> took fire, but this was kept under.</p>

<p>"After about forty minutes the <i>Good Hope</i> seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
break out of the line and close towards the enemy, and she
was not seen again (although some state that she was still
firing her after-turret)." According to the official report made
by the captain of the <i>Glasgow:</i> "At 7.50 p.m. an immense
explosion occurred on board <i>Good Hope</i> amidships, flames
reaching 200 feet high. Total destruction must have followed.
It was now quite dark."</p>

<p>The <i>Monmouth</i> and <i>Glasgow</i> still fought on gamely, both
sides firing at the flashes, the Germans firing salvoes. "The
<i>Monmouth</i> was very badly damaged by this time", continues
the account we have already quoted, "and she hauled off to
starboard, followed by the <i>Glasgow</i>, as the big ships had now
commenced to fire on us as well as the small ones. It was
very dark now, but owing to the fire on the <i>Monmouth</i> no
doubt the enemy had a good mark to aim at. The enemy's
fire ceased as soon as we turned away to starboard. It could
easily be seen as we passed the <i>Monmouth</i> that she had
suffered heavily, and it appeared to me that she was still on
fire. She also had a list to port and was down by the head.</p>

<p>"Our captain made a signal to her, asking if she was all
right, and was told that she was making water badly forward
and was trying to get her stern to the sea. He then asked
him if he could steer north-west, but received no reply. The
enemy were now coming towards us, and we thought that we
might have drawn them away from the <i>Monmouth</i>, but in a
few minutes we could see search-lights and gun-flashes, and
we knew that it was the <i>Monmouth</i> they were firing on."
Under the growing light of a full moon, which was now rising
slowly in the stormy heavens, the practically undamaged
German squadron was seen bearing down directly on the little
<i>Glasgow</i>, which, as she could by no possibility be of any
assistance to the <i>Monmouth</i>, made off at full speed to avoid
annihilation, and by 8.50 had run the enemy out of sight.
About half an hour later a number of flashes were seen afar
off, which, without doubt, marked the death throes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
gallant <i>Monmouth</i>. The <i>Glasgow</i> was badly knocked about.
She had an enormous gash in her side 9 feet long and 3 feet
wide, besides minor injuries. But she lived not only to fight
another day, but to take signal revenge on her opponents.</p>

<p>"Nothing could have been more admirable than the conduct
of the officers and men throughout. Though it was most
trying to receive a great volume of fire without chance of
returning it adequately, all kept perfectly cool, there was no
wild firing, and discipline was the same as at battle-practice.
When target ceased to be visible, gunlayers spontaneously
ceased fire."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the only guns in the British
squadron equal in power to the sixteen 8·2-inch much more
modern weapons of the two big German armoured cruisers
were the two 9·2-inch guns carried by the <i>Good Hope</i>, one of
which was knocked out ten minutes after the battle began.</p>

<p>The <i>Glasgow</i>, on the second day after her escape, had a
curious experience, if we are to believe the story of one of
her men, as she ran plump into a sleeping whale! "That was
another shock for us. The ship trembled and we all rushed
up on deck to find out what had happened." The <i>Glasgow</i>
picked up the pre-Dreadnought battleship <i>Canopus</i>, which
at the time of the fight was unfortunately 200 miles away
to the southward, and both ships proceeded in company to
Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. The German ships do
not appear to have followed them, but went to Valparaiso,
presumably to send home news of their victory. The news of
the disaster to Sir Christopher Cradock's squadron naturally
created great enthusiasm in Germany and corresponding grief
in this country. But the naval authorities, in dead secrecy,
at once prepared to settle accounts with Von Spee and his
ships. On the 8th December, just over a month after the
catastrophe off Coronel, their efforts bore the fullest fruit.
On the previous day a squadron consisting of the battle-cruisers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
<i>Invincible</i> and <i>Inflexible</i> and the cruisers <i>Carnarvon</i>,
<i>Cornwall</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, and <i>Kent</i>, under the command of Sir F. C.
Doveton Sturdee, had arrived at Port Stanley in the Falkland
Islands, their crews greeting the <i>Glasgow</i>, which was lying
there in company with the <i>Canopus</i>, with round after round
of cheering.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these remote islands were unfeignedly
glad to see the new arrivals, since they had received warning
that they might expect a German raid. At 8 a.m. the look-outs
on Sapper Hill to the south-west of Port Stanley reported
columns of smoke coming up over the south-west horizon.
Soon afterwards a two-funnelled ship and a four-funneller
were made out, and the <i>Kent</i> was ordered out to the harbour
mouth and orders given for all ships to raise steam for full
speed. The <i>Kent</i>, it is interesting to note, went into action
this day flying the silken ensign and jack which had been
presented by the ladies of Kent on her first commission. To
conceal the presence of the two big battle-cruisers, which
might be spotted by their tripod masts, these two ships were
ordered to stoke up with oil fuel, and the thick black greasy
smoke billowing from their funnels soon shrouded the harbour
with a dusky veil. Twenty minutes later other smoke columns
were reported more to the southward.</p>

<p>The two ships first observed, which proved to be the
<i>Gneisenau</i> and <i>Nürnberg</i>, continued to advance steadily towards
the island, training their guns on the wireless station,
and about an hour and a half after they had first been sighted
came within 11,000 yards of the <i>Canopus</i>, which let fly at
them with her big guns, firing over the low-lying land between
the south side of the harbour and the open sea. The
Germans at once hoisted their colours and turned away.
Then, seeing the <i>Kent</i> at the harbour mouth, they turned
towards her, but very shortly afterwards turned away again
and went off at full speed towards their consorts, who were
now coming up. It is thought that they must have got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
glimpse of the "surprise packet", in the shape of the <i>Invincible</i>
and <i>Inflexible</i>, that was awaiting their advent.</p>

<p>At a quarter to ten the <i>Carnarvon</i>, <i>Inflexible</i>, <i>Invincible</i>,
and <i>Cornwall</i> weighed and stood out to sea in the order named,
and overtook the <i>Kent</i> and the <i>Glasgow</i>, which had gone out
and joined her a few minutes earlier. The German ships were
now in full sight to the south-east&mdash;hull down, and doing the
"<i>Goeben</i> glide" for all they were worth. In the British ships
the stokers were working furiously, the smoke belching in
thick volumes from the funnels; and, with every man at his
post, their decks flooded with water as a preventive against
fire, and hoses ready, the vessels gradually gathered way.</p>

<p>At 10.25 the big ships were making 23 knots, and gradually
drew ahead of their consorts. The <i>Invincible</i> led, the
<i>Inflexible</i> followed at some little distance on her starboard
quarter. The <i>Glasgow</i>&mdash;all on board burning with eagerness
to avenge their late squadron-mates&mdash;was ordered to keep at
2 miles distance from the flagship. It was a fine, clear, bright
day, comparatively warm for those latitudes, and it was easy
to keep the enemy in sight.</p>

<p>Shortly before one o'clock the two battle-cruisers opened
fire with their big guns, presently concentrating on the light
cruiser <i>Leipzig</i>. She was not hit, but the big shots crept
closer and closer, till after about a quarter of an hour she
turned away to the south-west, followed by the <i>Dresden</i> and
<i>Nürnberg</i>. At the same time the remaining German ships,
the two big armoured cruisers, turned slightly to port and
began to return the fire of our battle-cruisers. Thenceforward
the fighting resolved itself into two battles, one between
the big ships, the other between the smaller cruisers.</p>

<p>As soon as the German light cruisers turned off to their
starboard hand the <i>Kent</i>, <i>Glasgow</i>, and <i>Cornwall</i> started after
them in accordance with the orders they had received from
Admiral Sturdee. The <i>Bristol</i> had previously signalled that
three more Germans, looking like colliers or transports, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
appeared off the Falklands, and, having received orders to
take the armed auxiliary cruiser <i>Macedonia</i> with her and
destroy them, had proceeded to chase them to the westward.
The strangers turned out to be two and not three ships, the
<i>Baden</i> and <i>St. Isabel</i>. Both were captured and sunk after
the removal of their crews.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Invincible</i> and <i>Inflexible</i> were pressing
closer and closer on the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>. "Suddenly
we altered course", wrote a midshipman on board the
<i>Invincible</i> to his father,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> "and made for the enemy. I had
not noticed we were closing, and when their first salvo went
off I was still on the top of the turret. I could see all the
shells coming at us, and I felt they were all coming straight
at me. However, they all missed except one, which hit the
side of the ship near the ward-room, and made a great green
flash, and sent splinters flying all round. I hopped below
armour quickly and started working again. We were nearing
the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and began firing for all we were worth.
We hit again and again. First our left gun sent her big
crane spinning over the side. Then our right gun blew her
funnel to atoms, and then another shot from the left gun
sent her bridge and part of the forecastle sky-high.</p>

<p>"We were not escaping free, however. Shots were hitting
us repeatedly, and the spray from the splashes of their shells
was hiding the <i>Scharnhorst</i> from us. Suddenly a great livid
flame rushed through the gun-ports, and splinters flew all
round, and we felt the whole 150 or 200 tons of the turret
going up in the air. We thought we were going over the
side and would get drowned like rats in a trap. However,
we came down again with a crash that shook the turret
dreadfully, and continued firing as hard as ever. Nothing
in the turret was out of order at all. The range continued
to come down, and the whistles of the shells that flew over
us grew into a regular shriek. Down came the range, 11,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
10,000, 9000, 8800 yards. We were hitting the <i>Scharnhorst</i>
nearly every time. One beauty from our right gun got one
of their turrets fair and square and sent it whizzing over the
side." By 3.30 the <i>Scharnhorst</i> was in a bad way. She was
on fire, smoke and steam poured out of her in many places,
and when a shell would knock a big hole in her side a dull
furnace-like glow was seen within. Several of her guns were
out of action and she now turned partially to starboard, apparently
with the idea of getting her starboard guns to bear.</p>

<p>Just after four o'clock she was observed to give a heavy
roll to port. She slowly listed farther and farther over, till
she lay on her beam-ends, and at 4.17 disappeared below the
waves in a dense cloud of smoke and steam. The <i>Gneisenau</i>,
passing on the far side of the mass of scattered debris marking
the grave of her consort, still spat out defiance from her
guns. But her hours were numbered, and everyone on board
must have known that it was only a matter of minutes before
her two huge opponents settled accounts with her. She put
up a first-rate fight for nearly two hours longer. She ranged
her guns well and hit her adversaries again and again. But
each of them was much more than her match, and their great
850-pound projectiles got her time after time.</p>

<p>"5.10. Hit, hit!" wrote one of the <i>Gneisenau's</i> officers
in a pocket diary.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "5.12. Hit! 5.14. Hit, hit, hit! again!
5.20. After-turret gone. 5.40. Hit, hit! On fire everywhere.
5.41. Hit, hit! burning everywhere and sinking.
5.45. Hit! men dying everywhere. 5.46. Hit, hit!" The
ship must have been an inferno. At last she could only fire
a single gun at intervals, and at 5.40 the <i>Invincible</i>, <i>Inflexible</i>,
and <i>Carnarvon</i> closed in on the stricken leviathan
and the "cease fire" was sounded. At six o'clock she turned
slowly, slowly, over to port till only her rounded side was
visible lying in the water like a great whale, with those of
her crew who survived walking and crawling over it. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
suddenly, down she went amid a swirl of waters, leaving
those of her crew who were not sucked down with her
struggling amid the waves. During the fighting the weather
had changed for the worse, the sea had begun to rise, and
now a cold drizzle was falling.</p>

<p>"Out boats," was the order on board the British ships,
and no pains were spared to rescue their late enemies.
Some of them had their heads quite turned and tried to
kill their rescuers, or jumped into the sea again and drowned
themselves. "One officer tried to shoot us with an automatic
pistol, but it was wrenched from his hand and we escaped,"
wrote the midshipman before quoted. It is thought that
before she sank 600 of the <i>Gneisenau's</i> ship's company had
been killed or wounded. The British seamen, working indefatigably,
were only able to save less than 200, fourteen of
whom subsequently died from the effects of cold and exposure.</p>

<p>We must now return to the other running fight which had
been proceeding between the smaller ships on both sides.
The Germans had no notion of fighting if they could avoid it,
and seem to have gone off "helter-skelter" without assuming
any definite formation. The <i>Glasgow</i> was our fastest cruiser
and was ordered to head off the <i>Nürnberg</i> and <i>Leipzig</i>. As
for the <i>Dresden</i>, she seems to have got a very long start from
the first and was never overtaken. The <i>Glasgow</i> opened fire
on the <i>Leipzig</i> and <i>Nürnberg</i> with her 6-inch guns about
three o'clock, and succeeded in making them alter course.
The former turned to meet the <i>Glasgow</i>, while the latter was
obliged to turn in a direction which rendered it easier for the
<i>Kent</i> to come up with her. The <i>Kent</i>, an older and slower
ship than the <i>Nürnberg</i>, made a record spurt and succeeded
in getting within range of the German. She had but little
coal on board. "The old <i>Kent</i> set off and her engines worked
up to 22 knots&mdash;more than she had ever done on her trials.
Then the word was passed that there was hardly any coal
left. 'Well,' said the captain, 'have a go at the boats.' So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
they broke up all the boats, smeared them with oil, and put
them in the furnaces. Then in went all the armchairs from
the ward-room and the chests from the officers' cabins. They
next burnt the ladders and all. Every bit of wood was sent
to the stokehold. The result was that the <i>Kent's</i> speed
became 24 knots."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But it was five o'clock before she could
get within range and both ships went at it hammer and
tongs for an hour, by which time the <i>Nürnberg</i> was evidently
on fire. The sea was by now rather choppy and the atmosphere
somewhat misty. Just after half-past six the <i>Nürnberg</i>,
well alight forward, ceased firing. The <i>Kent</i> thereupon
ceased fire also and closed in to 3300 yards; but, as the German
still kept her colours flying, she once more set her guns
to work. Five minutes of this and down fluttered the German
ensign, and the <i>Kent</i> set herself to save as many of her late
opponents as she could; but she was, of course, handicapped
by having burnt her boats, and only twelve could be rescued
with the assistance of the <i>Cornwall</i>. It was nearly half-past
seven before the <i>Nürnberg</i> took her final plunge.</p>

<p>The <i>Kent</i> was hit a considerable number of times and
lost four killed and a dozen wounded, nearly all by one shell.
She had, moreover, a very narrow escape from destruction,
from which she was only saved by the heroism of Sergeant
Charles Mayes of the Royal Marines. In the words of the
notification awarding him the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal:
"A shell burst and ignited some cordite charges in the casemate.
Sergeant Mayes picked up a charge of cordite and
threw it away. He then got hold of a fire-hose and flooded
the compartment, extinguishing the fire in some empty shell-bags
which were burning. The extinction of this fire saved
a disaster which might have led to the loss of the ship."</p>

<p>While the <i>Kent</i> was disposing of the <i>Nürnberg</i>, the
<i>Glasgow</i> and afterwards the <i>Cornwall</i> tackled the <i>Leipzig</i>.
"We continued to fight the <i>Leipzig</i>," writes one<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> of the <i>Glasgows</i>,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and the <i>Cornwall</i> was now coming up to help us, so
she hauled off again, and we followed. We soon got close
enough to open fire again, and this time we had begun to
make good shooting though it was at a long range. She had
then turned slightly towards us, and we began to get her
range; but she was altering her course so much that it made
it extremely difficult to hit her. We got one shell through
our control and the splinters killed one man and injured
several others. This was the only shell that did much
damage. We were getting much closer now and our shells
were hitting her as her fire slackened, but we had to be
careful owing to the enemy throwing mines over the side.
As we got closer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our fire became even more effective, she
turned to port and we had to cease fire for a while. Then
the other battery had a chance and they made some very
good shooting. By this time she had altered course again
and this allowed the <i>Cornwall</i> to open fire on her, but it
looked to us as if her fire was going very short. The <i>Leipzig</i>
now fired at the <i>Cornwall</i> and we got up fairly close and
poured in a heavy fire. She then took fire on her stern, and
her mast and funnel went over the side. Then she was
smoking amidships and a shell knocked away the upper half
of her second funnel. She was now beaten but she refused
to answer our signal to surrender, and after a while we
opened fire on her again, and, as it was by this time quite
dusk, we could see the shells strike and burst. She was lying
quite helpless now and burning fiercely from amidships to
the after end. The smoke which came from her in dense
clouds, came across us and we could smell the faint burning.</p>

<p>"Then she fired one of her guns, and this was a signal for
a fresh outburst from us. We kept steaming round near the
burning ship, and then we saw them fire a white rocket. We
and the <i>Cornwall</i> then lowered boats and went nearer to the
now sinking ship." "When we went right close to", says
another eyewitness, "she looked just like a night-watchman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
bucket&mdash;all holes and fire. She was a mass of white heat.
You would not think an iron ship would blaze like that." To
continue to quote the previous narrator: "Our boats had
just arrived near the ship, when she rolled gently over and
then sank. Our boats picked up ten of them and the <i>Cornwall's</i>
four.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Everyone seemed overjoyed to think we
had avenged the loss of the <i>Good Hope</i> and <i>Monmouth</i>, and
especially so later on when we heard that the <i>Kent</i> had sunk
the <i>Nürnberg!</i>"</p>

<p>The <i>Glasgow</i>, which had fought and escaped at Coronel, and
participated in the signal revenge taken upon Von Spee and
his squadron off the Falklands, was lucky enough to assist in
the final act of retribution when the <i>Dresden</i>, which had got
away for a time, was caught and sunk off Juan Fernandez&mdash;Robinson
Crusoe's island. The <i>Glasgow</i> and <i>Orama</i> came up
from the south-west, and presently the <i>Kent</i> appeared hurrying
up from the south-east. After the exchange of some
shots the <i>Dresden</i> appeared to be on fire and hoisted a very
large white flag, while many of her crew jumped overboard
and made for her boats, which were in the water at a little
distance off. "As soon as it was clear she did not intend to
fight again, we lowered boats and sent medical aid, and several
of the wounded were brought alongside the ship for treatment."
Eventually the magazine seems to have been blown
up&mdash;possibly intentionally by her officers, as just previously
the German ensign was re-hoisted, and she sank with it and
the white flag of surrender both flying.</p>

<p>With the sinking of the <i>Dresden</i> the German Navy disappeared
from the ocean. Not a man-of-war of German
nationality floated in the "Seven Seas", and only in the
security of their own fortified harbours and in the mine-defended
area of the Baltic dared the "black, white, and red
flag" show itself.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Early</span> in November, 1914, a German squadron of considerable
force made what the Germans proudly termed a "hussar
stroke", a number of big ships approaching the English coast,
driving off the <i>Halcyon</i>, an antiquated gunboat, and firing a
few futile shots at long range at Yarmouth. Suddenly they
turned tail and made off. They strewed mines behind them,
one of which blew up the submarine D5; but the so-called
raid was a case of "much cry, little wool", and finally ended
by the <i>Yorck</i>, a very big cruiser, running into a German mine
defending the entrance to the Jahde and being blown up
with great loss of life.</div>

<p>On the 23rd November a patrol vessel rammed the German
submarine U 18 off the north coast of Scotland. She was
badly damaged and shortly afterwards foundered. Five days
later the navy suffered a severe loss in the blowing up of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
pre-Dreadnought battleship <i>Bulwark</i> as she lay at her buoy off
Sheerness. The cause of this catastrophe was, of course, impossible
to ascertain with any certainty, as the ship was sunk
and destroyed with almost every soul on board.</p>

<p>Encouraged by what they seem to have considered the
success of their vaunted "hussar stroke" at Yarmouth, the
Germans thought they might as well have another. This
time their raid resulted in the deaths of a large number of
civilians, men, women, and children, at East and West Hartlepool,
Whitby, and Scarborough, upon which undefended places
they opened fire with their heavy artillery. Another "famous
victory!" To make it look more like an operation of war,
and to excuse themselves to neutrals, they tried to make out
that these towns were fortified positions. It is not very likely
that anyone believed them, since these places are well known
to be nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was a carefully-planned affair.
"Practically the whole fast-cruiser force of the German Navy,
including some great ships vital to their fleet and utterly
irreplaceable," wrote Mr. Winston Churchill to the Mayor of
Scarborough, "has been risked for the passing pleasure of
killing as many English people as possible, irrespective of sex,
age, or condition, in the limited time available to this military
and political folly. They were impelled by the violence of
feelings which could find no other vent."</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the First Lord's diagnosis of the
cause of the raid was absolutely correct, though it was perhaps
more generally considered that it had the ulterior
motive of "frightening" the British nation. So far from doing
anything of the kind, it produced a perfect rush to enlist.
Men wanted to take a personal hand in the payment due for
such violence. The few British destroyers and patrolling
vessels that were encountered opened fire on the big German
leviathans, but were naturally in no position to put up anything
of a fight against such overwhelming odds. That the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Germans were unable to sink them goes to prove that they
were in too great a hurry to fire carefully, as all they wanted
to do was to escape, for, to quote the official announcement,
"on being sighted by British vessels the Germans retired at
full speed, and, favoured by the mist, succeeded in making
good their escape". What a pity that mist intervened! But
it merely postponed the evil day for the raiders after all.</p>

<p>Our men-of-war about this time set to work to give the
German positions along the Belgian coast another shaking up,
and the year finished by a brilliantly executed naval air raid
on Cuxhaven and the German war-ships lying in the Elbe, in
the process of which their escorting flotilla had a somewhat
unique scrap with German submarines and Zeppelins, an
account of which will be found in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The year 1915 opened badly for us with the loss of the
<i>Formidable</i>&mdash;a sister-ship to the <i>Bulwark</i>&mdash;which was torpedoed,
it is supposed, by a German submarine well down the
Channel. At two o'clock in the morning there was a heavy
explosion, and the ship began to settle down to starboard.
There was no panic, the boats were got out, and some were
already in the water when there was a second explosion and
a mass of debris was shot into the air. The sea was rough,
and the survivors, who numbered less than a hundred, endured
severe hardships. Some were rescued by a Brixham trawler,
and others managed to row ashore at Lyme Regis. "The
discipline was splendid," said a bluejacket survivor.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> "The
last that I saw of Captain Loxley"&mdash;who was in command of
the ship&mdash;"was that he was on the bridge calmly smoking
a cigarette. Lieutenant Simmonds superintended the launching
of the boats, and as he got the last away I heard the
Captain say: 'You have done well, Simmonds'. The stokers
must have done magnificently, as they drew all the fires, and,
steam being shut off, there was no boiler explosion when the
<i>Formidable</i> sank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>"Captain Loxley was as cool as a cucumber. He gave his
orders calmly and coolly, just as though the ship was riding
in harbour with anchors down. I thought nothing was amiss.
The last words I heard him say were: 'Steady, men, it's all
right. No panic, keep cool; be British. There's life in the
old ship yet!' Captain Loxley's old terrier 'Bruce' was
standing on duty at his side on the fore-bridge at the last."</p>

<p>One of the few stokers who were saved said that they were
expecting to be relieved, and to have gone back to port, in
about another hour. "An officer passed down by us. He
stopped and explained in a matter-of-fact way that the ship
had been struck, was sinking fast, and it was now a question
of saving as many lives as possible. He advised us to go on
deck and lay hold of anything we could." One of the finest
examples of self-sacrifice was given by Bugler S. C. Reed of
the Royal Marines, a mere boy, who, when advised to use his
drum to keep himself afloat, replied that he had thought of it,
but had given it to one of the bluejacket boys for that purpose,
as the lad had nothing to keep himself afloat in the heavy
seas then prevailing, and <em>that he did not feel very nervous</em>.
Surely the cool courage in the face of death, superlative
bravery, and absolute self-devotion that have been displayed
during the last few months by officers and men&mdash;yes, and boys
too&mdash;of navy and army alike, have equalled, if not eclipsed,
the finest deeds of our forefathers "in the brave days of old".</p>

<p>At last, on 24th January, our eager navy had its chance of
castigating the evasive enemy. The Battle-cruiser Squadron,
consisting of the <i>Lion</i>, <i>Princess Royal</i>, <i>Tiger</i>, <i>New Zealand</i>,
and <i>Indomitable</i>, under the command of Sir David Beatty,
who flew his flag on the <i>Lion</i>, in company with Commodore
Goodenough's Light Squadron, comprising the <i>Southampton</i>,
<i>Nottingham</i>, <i>Birmingham</i>, and <i>Lowestoft</i>, was patrolling in
the North Sea, preceded some way ahead by the <i>Undaunted</i>,
<i>Arethusa</i>, and <i>Aurora</i>, with destroyer flotillas, when about
half-past seven in the morning the flashing of guns was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
observed to the south-south-east. Presently came a message
to the flagship from the <i>Aurora</i> that she was in action with
the enemy.</p>

<p>Speed was increased, and the British squadrons rushed at
full speed towards the scene of conflict. Other messages came
in from the ships in advance reporting that the enemy's force,
consisting of the <i>Blücher</i>, three battle-cruisers, and six light
cruisers, had altered course to south-east, while a number of
destroyers were heading to the north-west. The main body
of the enemy very shortly came in sight, but they were at
a great distance, and making off as fast as they knew how.
After them ploughed the British leviathans and their satellites,
but it was not till nine minutes after nine that the <i>Lion</i> got
in her first hit on the <i>Blücher</i> at something like 10 miles
distance!</p>

<p>The enemy were in "line ahead", the <i>Blücher</i> being the
rearmost ship. Their light cruisers were away ahead and
their destroyers on their port flank, apparently meditating a
dash against the advancing British. Our flotillas, with their
attendant cruisers, were at this time away on the port quarter
of the battle-cruisers, where they had been placed so as not
to obstruct the aim of the big guns by their smoke, but the
"M" division of destroyers was now sent ahead in order to
attend to the German flotilla.</p>

<p>By this time the leading German ship&mdash;supposed to be the
<i>Seydlitz</i>&mdash;was on fire, and so was the third ship in their line.
The enemy's destroyers now began to stoke up, and threw out
thick black clouds of smoke, under cover of which their big
ships altered course to the northward. As soon as this
man&#339;uvre was apparent, the British ships, which by now
were tearing through the water at tremendous speed, turned
to follow, whereupon their destroyers again evinced a disposition
to attack. But upon the <i>Lion</i> and <i>Tiger</i> turning their
guns upon them they thought better of it, and returned to
their former position. Our light cruisers kept station on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
port quarter of the enemy, ready to pounce upon any cripples.
Just after a quarter to eleven the <i>Blücher</i>, which had been
gradually falling astern, turned out of the line to port. She
was on fire, had a heavy list, and was evidently very badly
mauled. A few minutes later the periscopes of a number of
submarines were noticed on the starboard bow of our battle-cruisers,
which at once turned to port to avoid them.</p>

<p>At the pace at which our ships were travelling these
insidious foes would soon be left behind. Soon afterwards
the flagship, having received damage which could not be at
once repaired, was ordered to go off to the north-west, the
admiral calling the destroyer <i>Attack</i> alongside and going in
her to the <i>Princess Royal</i>, on board of which he rehoisted his
flag. On arrival he was informed that the <i>Blücher</i> had been
sunk, and that the remainder of the enemy's ships were making
off to the eastward in a badly-damaged condition.</p>

<p>The <i>Seydlitz</i> and <i>Derflinger</i>, particularly, were said to have
been desperately knocked about. But as the battle had now
approached the area of the German mine-fields, it was wisely
determined to break it off and return to English waters, the
<i>Lion</i>, which had received a shot in her condensers, being taken
in tow by the <i>Indomitable</i>. The only ships on our side that
were hit were the <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Tiger</i>, and the little <i>Meteor</i>,
which led the destroyers interposed between the German destroyers
and our main line; and the total casualties were only
fourteen officers and men killed and twenty-nine wounded.
The German losses must have been terrible.</p>

<p>One of the survivors of the <i>Blücher</i> gave a vivid account
of the effects of our gunnery.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> "The British guns were
ranging. Those deadly waterspouts crept nearer and nearer.
The men on deck watched them with a strange fascination.
Soon one pitched close to the ship, and a vast watery pillar, a
hundred metres high, fell lashing on the deck. The range had
been found. Now the shells came thick and fast, with a horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
droning hum. At once they did terrible execution.
The electric plant was soon destroyed, and the ship plunged
in a darkness that could be felt. Down below there was
horror and confusion, mingled with gasping shouts and moans
as the shells plunged through the decks. At first they came
dropping from the sky. They penetrated the decks, they bored
their way even to the stokehold. The coal in the bunkers
was set on fire. Since the bunkers were half-empty the fire
burned merrily. In the engine-room a shell licked up the oil,
and sprayed it around in flames of blue and green, scarring
its victims and blazing where it fell. Men huddled together
in dark compartments, but the shells sought them out, and
there death had a rich harvest.</p>

<p>"The terrific air-pressure resulting from explosion in a
confined space left a deep impression on the minds of the men
of the <i>Blücher</i>. The air, it would seem, roars through every
opening and tears its way through every weak spot. All
loose or insecure fittings were transformed into moving instruments
of destruction. Open doors bang to and jamb, and
closed iron doors bend outwards like tin plates, and through
it all the bodies of men are whirled about like dead leaves in
a winter blast, to be battered to death against the iron walls."

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> have had a good many surprises during the Great War,
and so also have the enemy; but the fine record of the British
air service is not the least of them. It is not that we had
not every confidence in the pluck and resourcefulness of our
gallant British flying-men, but, if we may trust available
sources of information, we began the war miles behind our
French friends and our German foes, both in numbers and
organization.</div>

<p>Of course no exact figures can be quoted, but, according
to an authority on aeronautic matters,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Germany alone was
in possession of a thoroughly organized and equipped fleet
of 1300 aeroplanes. According to the same authority, Austria
had about 100, France 800, and Russia 300, while we ourselves
are credited with 100 machines belonging to the military wing
of the air service, besides those in the naval wing, whose
number is not forthcoming, but which, I think, may fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
be put down at well below a hundred. Neither we nor our
allies had more than three or four air-ships or dirigible balloons,
while Germany had a fleet of nearly twenty, most being of
the famous Zeppelin type, from which very great things were
expected. The naval and military authorities in this country
either did not or would not believe in these "gas-bags", and,
so far, events seem to have proved that they were correct in
their views.</p>

<p>In every estimate of the strength of navies we must not
only make comparisons of material, but of personnel. "The
man behind the gun" is a factor of the highest importance,
and it is here that we "came in", handicapped as we were
in other respects. I do not think that I can do better than
again quote the same authority on this point. As regards the
enemy, his estimate of the German air personnel is that its
pilots were "mediocre, with a few brilliant exceptions". The
Austrians were "brave and skilful pilots badly organized".
As to our allies, he considers the French to have had "a very
uneven air service". "Many magnificent fliers, many very bad";
while the Russians possessed "numerous skilful and daring
aviators, but not very well equipped". We must not overlook
the little Belgian squadron of five-and-twenty aeroplanes,
which he assesses as "good", both in men and machines. We
may, without vanity, accept his estimate of our own aerial
establishment as "a small but highly efficient flying corps",
since its efficiency has been proved over and over again.</p>

<p>The "Royal Flying Corps" only dates from a few years
ago, and we are principally indebted to Major-General&mdash;then
Lieutenant-Colonel&mdash;Sir David Henderson, K.C.B., D.S.O., for
its formation. He had no easy job before him when he took
the matter in hand, since neither Admiralty nor War Office
appeared to be in any hurry to attain a commanding position
in the novel arm, in spite of the great efforts being made by
France, and more especially by Germany. However, nothing
daunted, he made the very best possible of the small beginnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
he was able to deal with, and we are now reaping the
harvest he sowed. For a time naval and military officers and
men worked together, but gradually, as numbers increased,
drew rather more apart, and the naval wing had its own
flying-schools at Eastchurch, near Sheerness, and at Upavon,
near Salisbury, its central air office at Sheerness, an establishment
at Hendon, and nine or ten air stations on the coast.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, confident in their numbers
and organization, the German aviators showed considerable
boldness, and their skilfulness in picking out our guns and
positions, and signalling them by flares, strips of glittering
tinsel, circling movements, and other devices to their gunners,
rendered the fire of their artillery&mdash;which at first greatly outnumbered
that of the Allies&mdash;very deadly indeed. Our own
airmen were by no means such adepts at this particular work
to begin with, but, few as they were, they soon proved themselves
the better men. They worked on the old principle that
so often brought us victory afloat in Nelsonian days. "Directly
you see an enemy go for him." This system of fighting
enabled Sir John French to report, quite early in the campaign,
that "The British Flying Corps has succeeded in establishing
an individual ascendancy which is as serviceable to us as it
is damaging to the enemy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Something in the direction of
the mastery of the air has already been gained." The fact
was that the very qualities of preciseness, method, painstaking,
and avoidance of risk which make the German so formidable
in some respects do not fit in where such warfare is concerned.</p>

<p>The German cavalry was the same. It worked by the
book. If it could mass against ours at a strength of three
to one, then by all the rules of the game we ought to have
retired or waited for their ponderous squadrons to ride us
down and overwhelm us by sheer weight of flesh and bone.
But when our dashing horsemen whirled into their masses
in their shirt-sleeves, and plied sabre and lance in a way that
showed they meant business, and then turned round and cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
their way home again in the same way, they did not like
it. They have never dared to "take on" our cavalrymen on
anything approaching equal terms. Brave as we must admit
the Germans have shown themselves, they have not the same
individual dash and self-reliance as the British races.</p>

<p>No German would ever attack single-handed like Sergeant
O'Leary, V.C. If any proof were wanted of this, one has
only to consider that the mass attack formations, which have
proved so deadly to our enemies, were deliberately designed
by the German military experts, with full knowledge of the
growing power of modern guns and rifles, because from their
experience of the war of 1870 they had formed the reasoned
opinion that in no other formation could they keep their
"cannon fodder" up to the scratch. All their views are well
set forth in a German pamphlet published some years ago,
entitled <cite>A Summer Night's Dream</cite>. It has been translated
into English, and is well worth perusal at the present time.</p>

<p>Now look at our own men. Here is what Viscount
Castlereagh wrote of them from the front to his wife last
autumn. "The thing that has impressed me most here has
been the aeroplane service; a splendid lot of boys who really
do not know what fear is."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The German army was provided
with a large quantity of guns especially designed for bringing
down hostile airmen; but they proved singularly ineffective,
and our flying-men simply laughed at them. And yet, with
all their talk of air-raids and the effect they were supposed to
have on this country, the German fliers have never attempted
to attack any place over here where they thought there might
be any guns in waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>The Naval Air Service, primarily intended for scouting
at sea, not only for hostile ships but for submarines&mdash;for
from high up these deadly craft are visible deep under water,
just in the same way that one can see fish from a bridge
that are invisible from the bank&mdash;was originally equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
with water-planes, fitted with floats instead of wheels, so that
the naval aeronauts could rise from or alight on the water.</p>

<p>But though these machines proved of the greatest service
in guarding and watching the Channel and the Straits of
Dover, the enterprising spirit of the naval and marine officers
who acted as air pilots, squadron commanders, &amp;c., was not
content to devote itself entirely to such necessary but perhaps
rather monotonous work. The Naval Air Service after the
outbreak of war went ahead by leaps and bounds. Not only
were the numbers of sea-planes increased, but wheeled aeroplanes
were purchased as fast as they could be obtained, and
supported by a whole fleet of armoured motors fitted with
machine-guns, a regular naval air contingent appeared on the
Continent ready to assist the army by raiding in any direction
likely to be of service. All sorts of mechanics, motor-drivers,
and other men were enlisted for special service with this new
organization, which lost no time in proving its great value
and efficiency.</p>

<p>The leading spirit and commanding officer was Commander
Samson, R.N., and by 4th September, 1914, he was able to
report that bombs had been dropped on four German officers
and forty men who had got rather too near Dunkirk. Then,
about a fortnight later, came the first raid in force against the
enemy's country, which created quite a scare in the German
frontier cities, since, judging our gallant airmen by their own
low-down standards, they feared for the lives and property of
civilian inhabitants.</p>

<p>After carefully and successfully assisting in covering the
transit of the Expeditionary Force to France, a temporary
base for the naval wing was established at Ostend. It was
to assist in establishing this base that the three battalions of
Royal Marines were dispatched to that place in the early part
of the war. Other outlying bases were gradually established
in Belgium. The naval motors, acting in conjunction with the
Belgians, made things very warm for the prowling Uhlans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and eventually a regularly organized combined expedition
of motors and aeroplanes was directed against Cologne and
Düsseldorf, with the object of destroying the Zeppelin sheds
at these places and, haply, any Zeppelins that might be taking
their repose within.</p>

<p>It fell to Flight-Lieutenant Collet of the Royal Marine
Artillery to score the first "bull's-eye". This officer had
attracted some attention by the way he had handled a heavy
German-built biplane which the Admiralty had bought from
a Leipzig firm in 1913. In the hands of the German pilot
who came over with her the new machine appeared but a
slow and lumbering affair, but flown by Collet she became
endued with a new life, and was made to perform all sorts of
startling man&#339;uvres. "To see him descend for a thousand
feet or so," says an eye-witness, "in a closely wound spiral,
with the machine standing vertically on one wing-tip, was an
education in the handling of big aeroplanes."</p>

<p>Accompanied by other aviators, Lieutenant Collet set out
from their base on 22nd September, and made for Düsseldorf,
about 100 miles distant from Antwerp. Here, flying very low,
he dropped four bombs on the Zeppelin shed which was the
special object of attack. What damage was done was not
ascertained. The attacking machine was only struck by a
single bullet, which did no damage, and Collet and his companions
regained their base without difficulty.</p>

<p>About a fortnight later another raid was made against the
same sheds and also against those at Cologne.</p>

<p>The aviators on this occasion were Squadron-Commander
Spencer-Grey and Flight-Lieutenants Marix and Sippe, all
belonging to the Royal Navy. The last-named had trouble
with his engine shortly after starting and had to drop out,
but the remaining two rushed along through the growing
light&mdash;the start had been made at the first streak of dawn&mdash;Grey
making for Cologne and Marix for Düsseldorf. There
was a good deal of fog, which, while it served them to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
certain extent by concealing their approach, at the same time
made it no easy job to steer a correct course. Travelling at
80 miles an hour Grey reached Cologne, but had no luck.
Owing to the fog he was unable to locate the Zeppelin shed of
which he was in search, and would not drop a bomb without
a definite and legitimate objective, for fear of harming women
and children. He, however, was able to do some damage to
the railway station.</p>

<p>As for Marix, he found his way to the shed already struck
by Collet. Rising to a great height, he made a spiral dive at
the tremendous speed of 140 miles an hour. He had been
seen some time before, and was greeted with a tremendous
fusillade from machine-guns, anti-aeroplane guns, and rifles.
His machine was struck several times, but he descended to
within 500 feet of the shed to which a Zeppelin had been
recently removed from that damaged by Collet, let go his
bombs, and shot upwards again with marvellous velocity.
As he went he saw that at least one of his projectiles had
scored a success, for a volcano of flame was spouting 500 feet
into the air. There was one Zeppelin the less. His "mount"
had been hit no less than twenty times and two of his control-wires
cut, but by the exercise of great judgment and skill he
contrived to travel for 10 miles on his way back and to get
across the frontier, where he was met by a Belgian car and
taken safely to Antwerp.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Globe</i> who was at Düsseldorf at the
time gives the following account of what an eyewitness saw
of Flight-Lieutenant Marix's exploit and its effect. "A friend
of mine saw an aeroplane one day near Düsseldorf. He followed
its movements with great anxiety, and saw that it
dropped when it was close by the Zeppelin shed. He had an
idea that something was wrong, but about 200 metres from
the ground the machine turned again and disappeared. Almost
at the same moment he heard two explosions, and a few
moments after saw big flames of a light colour, giving him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the impression that the whole shed was on fire. My friend
went down to the place as quickly as he could, but at a
distance of a few hundred metres the people who had already
run to the spot were kept away by a ring of soldiers. A few
minutes later a rumour spread through the crowd that two
more enemy aeroplanes were reported from Cologne, and
immediately all the soldiers were ordered near the shed to be
ready for firing at the new-comers. My friend followed the
soldiers, and came quite near the place where he had seen
the flames. He saw that the contents of the shed had been
entirely burnt out, and only the walls of the building were
erect. In the shed was the carcass of a Zeppelin, burned and
broken to pieces. It was one big heap of aluminium."</p>

<p>The next exploit of the Naval Air Service was the attack
on the Zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen, on the Lake of
Constance. There are three or four big sheds here close
together, with workshops and all appliances for building and
fitting out these monster air-ships. The newspapers had for
some time previously been publishing paragraphs giving
accounts of Zeppelin experiments at this place. Some may
have been more or less correct, while others bore the stamp
of the usual "bogey-bogey" stories set about by the Germans
with the somewhat childish idea of frightening us. Anyway
the naval airmen made up their minds to go and see for themselves.
Of course their departure from the usual scene of their
activities in the north was made "without beat of drum", and,
as Friedrichshafen was something like 150 miles from the
French frontier, their visit was entirely unexpected.</p>

<p>The raiders were Squadron-Commander Briggs, Flight-Commander
Babbington, and Flight-Lieutenant Sippe, all of
the Royal Navy. They are supposed to have started from
the neighbourhood of Belfort, that very strongly fortified
town on the eastern frontier of France. They were mounted
on similar machines&mdash;Avro biplanes. Heading almost due
east, they struck the Rhine in the vicinity of Basle&mdash;where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
turns almost at a right angle from east to north&mdash;flew upstream
as far as Schaffhausen with its picturesque falls, and
then struck across country to Ludwigshafen, at the western extremity
of Lake Constance, or the Boden See as the Germans
term it. Thence they steered directly down the lake at their
objective, the cluster of hangars and workshops on the lakeside,
just east of the town of Friedrichshafen. Their advent
was both seen and heard, and the whirr of their propellers
was at once answered by the stutter of Maxims, the banging
of guns, and the popping of musketry. But it is not easy to
disable an aeroplane unless you are successful in damaging it
in a vital part; so, regardless of this very warm reception, the
naval airmen swooped down one after the other from the high
altitudes at which they were travelling, and, passing over their
target at a height of about 1200 feet, discharged their cargoes
of bombs.</p>

<p>Commander Briggs was the first to arrive and drop his
bombs, but his petrol tank being pierced by a bullet the petrol
ran out and he was brought to the ground, where he was
made prisoner and taken off to hospital, having received some
injuries from his fall. Babbington and Sippe, following in
his tracks, bombarded first the hangars and afterwards the
Zeppelin factory, and, circling round, flew off down the Rhine
and arrived safely at their starting-point, though their machines
had suffered some minor damages. Both were decorated on
their return with the Cross of the Legion of Honour, which
was pinned on their breasts by General Thevenet, the Governor
of Belfort. All three, too, appeared as recipients of the
Distinguished Service Order in the New Year's Honours List.
And they had well earned their distinctions. Putting on one
side the risks inseparable from such an enterprise, they had
flown right into the enemy's country for a very considerable
distance, over a mountainous district and in quite unfavourable
weather conditions, and had created a tremendous moral effect
in the enemy nations. They had probably done a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
amount of material damage to the hangars and workshops,
possibly to one or more Zeppelins as well, but no certain
details as to the extent have yet become available.</p>

<p>The Germans had been taught to expect great things from
their well-organized and numerous fleets of air-ships and
aeroplanes. They were to bombard London, defeat our fleets,
and terrorize the whole of our "right little, tight little island"
with these monster gas-bags. And, lo and behold! before
anything of the kind had happened, here were these pestilent
English flying-men attacking them in their own country.
Not blindly dropping bombs just anywhere in haste to get
rid of them, frighten civilians, and get away as fast as
possible, but deliberately attacking&mdash;and hitting&mdash;selected
targets. German opinion was profoundly moved. No wonder
that their airmen felt that it "was up to them" to show their
fellow-countrymen what <em>they</em> could do. But what a poor
show it was! On 5th December one gallant airman got
within sight of Dover, but turned round and made off again.
On the 24th this one, or another, actually flew over the town
and dropped a bomb into a cabbage-patch. He was in too
much of a hurry to select a more important target, much less
hit it. The British reply, if such an unimportant exploit
could be deemed worthy of receiving a reply, was prompt and
effective. The very next day&mdash;Christmas Day&mdash;the Naval
Air Wing, working in conjunction with its own branch of
the service, carried out an extremely well-organized attack
upon Cuxhaven, the strongly-fortified port at the mouth of
the Elbe which protects the approaches to Hamburg. The
following officers participated in this exploit: Flight-Commanders
Oliver, Hewlett, and Ross, R.N., and Kilner, R.M.L.I.,
Flight-Lieutenants Miley and Edmonds, R.N., and Flight Sub-Lieutenant
Blackburn, R.N.</p>

<p>The aeroplanes were all of an identical type&mdash;Shorts&mdash;just
as those used against Friedrichshafen were "Avros"
and against Düsseldorf "Sopwiths". They were carried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
three very fast Channel steamers that had been "taken
up" by the Admiralty, each of which was commanded by a
naval officer belonging to the air service. It is interesting
to note that the navigating officer of one of these vessels
was Mr. Erskine Childers, a lieutenant in the Royal Naval
Volunteer Reserve, the author of that fascinating novel <cite>The
Riddle of the Sands</cite>, which deals most minutely with the
navigation of the German coastal waters between the Elbe
and the Zuyder Zee. The little expedition was convoyed by
the <i>Undaunted</i> and the "saucy" <i>Arethusa</i>&mdash;a pair of new
light cruisers which have proved themselves a most effective
type of war-vessel&mdash;and a cordon of submarines and destroyers.
Everything had been worked out in detail.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BRITISH AIR RAID ON CUXHAVEN<br />

<cite>Drawn by John de G. Bryan</cite></span>
</div>

<p>On approaching Heligoland, that German Gibraltar with
which we so foolishly parted some years ago, the sea-planes
were hoisted out and sped away on their errand of destruction.
It was a misty morning, and on arrival at Cuxhaven the
aviators were much hampered by a fog which lay in shallow
patches over the town and harbour, but it is thought that
they succeeded in destroying a Parseval air-ship in its shed
and in badly knocking about some of the Zeppelin sheds.
According to the German account they also dropped bombs
on a gasometer and on some men-of-war lying in the river, of
course "without doing any damage". The fog was, however,
much closer and thicker over the Elbe than over the town, so
that ships were in any case difficult targets.</p>

<p>But while our aviators were carrying out their mission,
under fire from guns of all sorts and kinds, there was a most
remarkable fight going on outside&mdash;a battle unprecedented
in the annals of warfare.</p>

<p>The aviators left the flotilla sharp at daybreak, and
it would seem that neither they nor their escort were seen.
But as the light grew, the British ships were picked up
by the look-outs on Heligoland, and an instant attack was
made upon them by submarines, sea-planes, and a couple of
the redoubtable Zeppelins. But the high speed of the British
vessels and the consummate seamanship and gunnery of their
crews defeated every attempt made to injure them. For
three hours they fought while waiting the return of the
aviators. The white flash made by the German torpedoes
in the water was detected by sharp eyes, ships and boats
dodged and turned and cleared the "lurking death" by the
"skin of their teeth". The sea-planes whirred overhead and
dropped their deadly bombs, which exploded in fire, smoke,
and fountains of water; but though they often fell close
alongside, none of the flotilla was touched. The big bluffing
Zeppelins also dropped a few, but they soon felt "they could
no longer stay", since the 100-pound shells from the <i>Arethusa</i>
and <i>Undaunted</i> were coming closer and closer, and their
crews knew&mdash;none better&mdash;that one fair hit would mean annihilation.
So, as the official report stated, they "were
easily put to flight". None of the German surface vessels
dared to show their noses outside, or, perhaps, were able
to disentangle themselves from their elaborate defences in
time, and after three of the daring raiders had been safely
re-embarked with their machines, the flotilla stood out to
sea again, leaving a detachment of submarines to look out
for the remainder. Three of the four remaining airmen were
rescued by this means, though their machines had to be
sunk. The seventh&mdash;Flight-Commander Hewlett, son of the
famous novelist&mdash;after dropping bombs on some of the
German ships, one of which, at any rate, he felt certain he
had hit, lost his way in the fog, missed the flotilla, and,
having trouble with his engine, descended to the sea not far
from Heligoland. Here he was picked up by a Dutch trawler.
He destroyed his engine and sank his machine, and after experiencing
two or three days of very heavy weather on board
the fishing-vessel was landed safely at Ymuiden, in Holland.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the same day was selected for a somewhat
feeble raid up the Thames by a German Taube, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a><br /><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
apparently, was working independently. The hostile air-craft
was seen, fired on, and, after harmlessly dropping a bomb here
and there, was chased away by three of our own airmen, and
there is reason to believe that its return journey ended at the
bottom of the North Sea.</p>

THE BRITISH AIR RAID ON CUXHAVEN<br />

<p>Seaplane 151, which was flown by Flight-Commander R. Ross in the raid which shook up the Germans and gave them a dose of their own medicine.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The day before the big expedition to Cuxhaven a dashing
attack was made by Squadron-Commander R. B. Davies, R.N.,
on a hangar which the Germans had erected at Etterbeek,
a suburb of Brussels, probably on the man&#339;uvre-ground of
the crack Belgian cavalry regiments, the Guides. This officer
travelled on a Maurice-Farman biplane and dropped eight
bombs on a shed which was supposed to contain a Parseval
air-ship, circled round, and dropped four more on his return
journey. He was unable to see exactly what damage he had
effected, on account of the clouds of smoke which arose from
the hangar. His machine was recognized by the citizens of
Brussels as belonging to the Allies, and his exploit created
great enthusiasm among them.</p>

<p>At last the German airmen determined to have a raid
of their own. A nice quiet little trip this was to be, out of
the way of nasty, unpleasant guns and Maxims. And so we
had the "great Zeppelin raid" on Yarmouth and on a few
quiet out-of-the-way villages in Norfolk, and the slaughter
of men, women, and children. The German aviators, however,
did more respectable work when considerable squadrons
of aeroplanes twice attacked Dunkirk in January, 1915. The
first attempt would appear to have been originally directed
against Dover or some other place on this side the Channel, as
sixteen German aeroplanes were sighted hovering over the
Channel. But either by reason of the good look-out kept
by our own airmen and gunners, or on account of unfavourable
weather conditions, the "Boches" changed the direction
of their flight and a dozen of them attacked Dunkirk and
dropped about thirty bombs. As usual, most of the victims
were civilians, but Dunkirk was a fortified town and an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
position of the allied armies, so that, but for the fact
that on one occasion the market-place seemed to be selected
for an especial target, we may consider these raids as legitimate
military operations. But the Germans were not able to
carry them out at their leisure. Belgian, French, and British
airmen rushed their machines aloft and engaged and drove off
the raiders with the loss of one of their machines, while a
couple of our naval officers flew off and countered at Zeebrugge,
dropping twenty-seven bombs on a couple of submarines and
on the guns mounted on the mole. One of them, Squadron-Commander
Davies, R.N., was attacked during his approach
by no less than seven hostile aeroplanes, but got away from
them with a slight wound and delivered his bombs at their
destination.</p>

<p>The following letter, written shortly before, and referring
to the first German raid on Dunkirk, is interesting as showing
the consciousness of superiority in the minds of our airmen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must tell you something about the beano we had yesterday.
It <em>was</em> a day! Engaged with three Taubes in the
morning and in the afternoon&mdash;and I went and dropped 18
bombs and 6 grenades on various works and the railway
at Ostend, with incidentally another scrap with a German
machine. Hope we tickled them up and gave them &mdash;&mdash; at
Ostend. We've got 'em scared stiff&mdash;absolutely. It's a great
game entirely. I hope we get to hear about what damage
we did at Ostend, though I'm afraid it's impossible. I know
I got the railway with one bomb&mdash;a clinking shot right in
the middle. I tell you they let us have it. The machine was
hit in nine places."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The writer was evidently "keen as mustard", and against
such airmen the German air service could make no headway.</p>

<p>The biggest air raid on record took place on Tuesday,
16th February, 1915, when no less than thirty-four sea-planes
and aeroplanes belonging to the Naval Wing made a combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
attack on the German positions on the Belgian littoral.
They were assisted by eight French airmen, who made a
determined attack on the German aeroplane depot at Ghistelles,
situated inland and south of Ostend, thereby preventing
the German airmen from intercepting our main attack. This
big "flight"&mdash;a regular "aery navy"&mdash;was commanded by the
redoubtable Wing-Commander Samson, R.N., who had made
things so hot for the Germans in Belgium that a price of
£1000 was set on his head; Wing-Commander Longmore,
R.N., and Squadron-Commanders Porte, R.N., and Courtney
and Rathbone of the Royal Marine Light Infantry.</p>

<p>It was a great performance. Most of the British aeroplanes
crossed the Channel in the teeth of very violent winds,
flying in the bitter cold of high altitudes and obstructed by
not infrequent "flurries" of snow. Once over the water, they
flew down over Ostend, Middelkirke, and Zeebrugge. Bombs
were dropped on the German guns hidden from the view of our
ships at all three places: the stations at Ostend and Blankenberghe
were either destroyed or much damaged, as well as
the power-station and mine-sweeping vessels at Zeebrugge
and a Zeppelin shed. Unfortunately no submarines were
seen. All this was carried out in the face of a very heavy
gun-fire from every class of weapon that the Germans could
get to bear on our "wild ducks". But all got away without
loss of life or limb, and with only a couple of machines
damaged. The celebrated airman Grahame-White, who served
in the expedition as a flight-commander, fell into the sea off
Nieuport, but was rescued by a French vessel. This is the
last big air raid carried out by the Naval Wing up to the time
of writing, and space forbids any mention of the hundred-and-one
smaller exploits carried out by its fliers, either aloft in the
air or working on the ground in their armoured motor-cars.
The price set on Commander Samson's head by the exasperated
"Boches" sufficiently indicates what a thorn in the side they
proved to the German desecrators of Belgium and France.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>




<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>
"The Fleet of England is her all in all:<br />

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now traced the beginnings of the Royal Navy,
glanced at some little-known episodes of the naval history
of Great Britain, sketched the development of our men-of-war
and their weapons, and finally endeavoured to portray&mdash;in
a very inadequate way, I am afraid&mdash;the gallant men who
man them, and some of their deeds in the greatest and most
terrible war that has ever been known in the history of the
world, I have arrived at the time when I must hoist the signal
"Permission to part company" with my readers.</p>

<p>But I cannot leave the subject of this book without some
reference to the part played by the navy in the Dardanelles.
The outstanding points in regard to the navy's participation
in these operations were without doubt the tremendous effect
of the monster guns of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, the severe fighting
which fell to the lot of the Naval and Marine Brigades in the
attack of the Turkish shore positions, and last, but not least,
the wonderful exploits of our submarines. The achievements
of Lieutenant Norman D. Holbrook, who, in the B11, crept
under five rows of mines and blew up the Turkish ironclad
<i>Messudiyeh;</i> and of Lieutenant Commander Martin Nasmith,
who, in the E11, penetrated right into the Sea of Marmora,
torpedoing transports and creating a scare in Constantinople
itself, are examples of that brilliant daring which has been
exemplified again and again during the war.</p>

<p>The operations against the Dardanelles forts opened on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the 3rd November last year, when an allied British and
French squadron bombarded those nearest to the entrance.
Operations were then practically suspended until the 19th
February, when the allied fleets returned to the attack in
greater force, and made a resolute attempt to break down the
defence of the narrow waterway leading to Constantinople.
The outer forts having been silenced, the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>,
with four other battleships, entered the Dardanelles and
bombarded the defences of what are known as the Narrows.
But they were unable to advance farther, partly on account
of the heavy mobile batteries of the Turco-Germans, but more
especially from the great danger of floating mines and of torpedoes
launched from stations on shore. These submarine
weapons began to take heavy toll of the allied ships. The
British battleships <i>Irresistible</i>, <i>Ocean</i>, and <i>Goliath</i> were all
sunk&mdash;the two first on the same day. With them, too, went
down the French battleship <i>Bouvet</i>, and, later on, the <i>Triumph</i>
and <i>Majestic</i> succumbed to torpedoes said to have been fired
from one of two submarines which are supposed to have made
their way to the scene of action from Germany. Space forbids
any further account of these operations, which are still being
continued; but, in order to give some idea of what they were
like, I cannot do better than quote from a letter just written to
his chum by a midshipman on board one of the ships engaged
in the Straits, so vivid an account does he give of the fighting
as it presented itself to his eyes:</p>

<p>"Since we have been out we have been in four or five big
actions and a large number of small ones. I think the hottest
one that this ship personally has been in was on Sunday, &mdash;&mdash;.
This ship and one other were ordered to reduce, or attempt to
reduce, two of the most powerful forts going. The action
commenced just when you&mdash;if you were a good boy&mdash;were
going to church. As usual we cleared for 'immediate action'
on the way in. I must say before the action I felt rather as
if I was going to the dentist to have a bad tooth out, but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the show started and we were fighting I felt as happy as a
lark, despite the infernal noise and smell!</p>

<p>"My action station is in No. &mdash; turret, two &mdash; guns. I
wear the officer's telepads, and have to sing out all the orders,
ranges, &amp;c., that come down from the controls, and work all
the voice pipes, &amp;c. If the lieutenant of the turret gets
knocked out I am supposed to take charge. The forts opened
a heavy fire as soon as we were in range, and as we were the
leading ship we had the concentrated fire of <em>both</em> forts on us
for the first quarter of an hour, one fort shifting to the second
ship later. The water round both ships soon became like an
animated moving fountain, with the ships as the centre, from
the splashes made by the falling shell, most of the splashes
reaching as high as the foretop (about 110 feet). We really
had a most miraculous time, considering the large amount of
shells fired at us and the comparatively small number of hits
we received. Also the way we managed to avoid getting any
casualties was a miracle, some of the men having most marvellous
escapes. However, we let them have it pretty hot as
well, and it was absolutely ripping to feel the ship lurch and
stop on her course as we let rip broadside after broadside at
them. After two and a half hours the forts ceased firing
altogether, and we drew off, having done our job.</p>

<p>"About the most exciting show I have had myself was
when I had to go away sweeping up the Straits one night in
a picket-boat. Our objective was to locate and blow up an
electric cable which was connected to a long row of mines at
a certain point in the Dardanelles. We started off at about
7.30 p.m., and it was an absolutely pitch-black night. There
were five other boats with us, and of course we could show
absolutely no lights. I was steering the boat, and it was hard
to see anything at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We arrived at about 10 p.m., and
at the position for commencing the sweep at about 11.15. The
Turks had a lot of beastly search-lights going. The first
sweep up they did not discover us, but the second time they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
fairly caught us and let rip with all sorts of things&mdash;Nordenfeldts,
rifles, pom-poms, and a few howitzers. It was beastly
uncanny hearing the shells shrieking and whizzing about in
the still air of the night&mdash;much worse than in daytime.
However, a picket-boat is a very difficult thing to hit even
at the best of times, and in a pitch-black night it wants a lot
of luck despite all the search-lights. As soon as they started
firing I commenced zigzagging all over the place, and the
nearest we had was about ten yards away, although a lot of
rifle bullets went whistling overhead. I was never more
pleased than when we turned round and started back to the
fleet. We blew up something, but whether it was the cable
or not I don't know. The boat next to us got into the middle
of a bunch of mines, and we had to stand by her; however,
by great luck she managed to clear, blowing up two mines
with rifles. We got back to the ship about 5 a.m., after quite
an exciting night. I really thought I looked quite ferocious
that night; life-saving waistcoat, overcoat, sea-boots, muffler,
a huge revolver with 60 rounds of ammunition, both my
pockets full of sandwiches, and a Thermos flask full of cocoa,
which I kept on spilling all over myself in the dark.</p>

<p>"We have been covering the landing and supporting the
advance of the troops. It is a pretty strenuous time, as we
are at action stations on and off from 5 or 6 a.m. till 7 or
8 p.m., with a night watch to keep as well, so we are kept
pretty busy. We also live in a constant state of 'immediate
action'."</p>

<p>But as it had been decided to supplement the naval attack
by the landing of an army, a disembarkation was effected
towards the end of April at five points on the Gallipoli Peninsula
and one on the Asiatic shore. The latter was carried
out by the French, but it was only intended to be a temporary
measure to assist the British landings on the western shore.
The troops, which were composed of British, Australians, and
New Zealanders, effected their landing in the face of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
tremendous opposition, making their way through masses of
wire entanglements under a terrible fire from all kinds of
weapons. Their losses were very great, but they effected their
object and established themselves on shore, and set about a
series of operations against the Turkish positions which are
still continuing. The navy's share was to cover the landing
with the fire of its big guns, and to transport the soldiers to
the shore. Its work was magnificent. The Turkish entrenchments
were plastered with high-explosive shell, while the
bluejackets and marines employed in the actual business of
landing the troops behaved with a coolness, energy, and gallantry
which has never been surpassed. Nor must it be forgotten
that the navy was represented in the landing force by
the newly-formed Naval Division, under the command of
Brigadier-General Paris of the Royal Marine Artillery, consisting
of several battalions of the Royal Marines and a
number of others formed from the R.N.V.R. and other reserves,
and distinguished one from the other by bearing the names
of celebrated naval commanders&mdash;such as "The Drake Battalion".
These had all been organized and trained by the
staff of the Royal Marines under the Adjutant-General, Sir
William Nicholls, and were commanded by naval, marine, or
in some cases army officers. As for their work in the campaign,
we have, so far, little or no information. Beyond extensive
mention in the casualty lists, the press seems to have
overlooked them. But their very losses prove that they have
been well to the front, and we may be sure that they have
given a very good account of themselves.</p>

<p>Everywhere the Royal Navy has proved itself worthy,
nay, more than worthy, of its gallant ancestors and their
gallant deeds. To quote Lord Charles Beresford, in a letter
written to the London Chamber of Commerce: "The brilliant
work of the Navy in clearing the North Sea and providing
safety for the transport to France of their comrades in the
sister service will be gratefully appreciated by the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Such work could only have been effective by superb organization,
loyalty to duty, and discipline, requiring not only caution
but courage. The watching fleets of the present day have
none of the charm and change to occupy their mind which
accompanied the sailing-ship navy, making and shortening
sail, trimming sails, tacking, and wearing, necessary for cruising
on the look-out. There were no air-vessels, mines, submarines,
or torpedoes in the old days, no under-water warfare.
The strain upon officers and men of the sea-going fleet in
these days is terrific: nothing to occupy their thoughts as
in the days of sailing-ships."</p>

<p>But with all this we know what the navy has done, and
we know that it will never be found wanting. Only let
us all try to emulate the spirit of thoroughness and devotion
to duty which has made our navy what it is; let us all try to
"do our bit", however small, and, in those inspired words of
our great poet Shakespeare which we should always bear in
mind&mdash;</p>

note, which indicates that there was some affinity between the ancient Grecian and
the Viking ideas with regard to figure-heads: "The Greeks never allowed an image
of an entering ship to arrive un-removed, and then it was conveyed to the shore to
salute the Goddess of the port. The altar 'to the Unknown God' St. Paul saw
<em>was actually to any unknown Deity of an approaching vessel</em>."</p></div>

said: "The corps of Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers is composed of men who have
not, as a rule, practical acquaintance with the sea, but are attracted by sympathy
and aspiration. The Committee suggest that there are grounds for maintaining that
a Volunteer Force affiliated to the Royal Marine Artillery&mdash;from the system of
training and discipline that would be established&mdash;would be a far more permanently
valuable force than any so-termed naval force in which are enrolled men not inured
to sea-life and who have no sufficient practical experience at sea, which experience
cannot be given by Government under any volunteer system we can devise."</p></div>
